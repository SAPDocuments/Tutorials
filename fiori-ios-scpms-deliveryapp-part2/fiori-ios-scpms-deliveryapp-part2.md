## Details
### You will learn  
In this tutorial series, you will create a Fiori for iOS application which will show tracking info for purchased packages. When you have finished all 8 tutorials, the application will have the following characteristics:

 - Connects to an **SAP HANA MDC (Multi-tenant Database Container) XS OData service**. It contains records of packages and their delivery status.
 - Uses **simplified OData querying** with the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS.
 - Implements **SAP Fiori for iOS controls** to show timeline data.
 - Configured for offline usage with **Offline OData**.

The final SAP Fiori for iOS application will look like the following:

![Use Existing](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part2-08.png)

Click **Next** to advance to the **OData Services** step.


[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](OData Services)]

In the **OData Services** page, you can define the back end connection. Here you will add the OData endpoint for the `DeliveryService` OData service.

![OData Services](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part2-11.png)

Click the **Plus** button, and from the context menu, select **New Destination...**. A dialog opens:

![OData Services](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part2-25.png)

At the **General** tab, enter the following details:

| Field | Value |
|----|----|
| Backend URL | `https://sapdevsdd27584c4.us2.hana.ondemand.com/codejam/wwdc/services/DeliveryService.xsodata` |

Expand the **Advanced destination options** node, and set the following:

| Field | Value |
|----|----|
| Proxy Type | `Internet` |
| URL rewrite mode | `Rewrite URL` |
| Maximum connections | `Server default` |

![OData Services](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part2-26.png)

At the **Authentication** tab, make sure **Authentication Type** is set to **No Authentication**.

![OData Services](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part2-27.png)

Click **OK** to save the backend configuration. It is now listed in the available destinations:

![OData Services](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part2-28.png)

Click **Next** to advance to the **Optional Features** step.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Optional Features)]

In the **Optional Features** page, you have the option to generate a **Master-Detail Application**, enable **logging** and **log uploads**, and enable **remote notifications**.

![Optional Features](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part2-12.png)

Make sure the checkboxes **Generate Master-Detail Application**, **Enable Logging** and **Enable Log Upload** are selected and click **Finish** to complete the wizard.

> Most likely the checkbox for **Remote Notifications** is disabled. This happens because no APNS endpoint is configured for the application definition in SAP Cloud Platform mobile service for development and operations. Once configured with a valid certificate, this option becomes available.


[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Generating the Xcode project)]

After you have clicked **Finish** in the previous step, the SDK Assistant now loads the OData service's metadata. This metadata describes the data model, and can be accessed via `<service URL>$metadata`. For your service, the metadata URL would be `https://sapdevsdd27584c4.us2.hana.ondemand.com/codejam/wwdc/services/DeliveryService.xsodata/$metadata`
Based on this metadata, the OData proxy classes will be generated for the Xcode project.

In addition, the configuration settings you have provided in the SDK Assistant are now being sent to SAP Cloud Platform mobile service for development and operations.

> **NB:** If you have already 3 native applications defined in SAP Cloud Platform mobile service for development and operations, the SDK Assistant will give the following error:

> ![Optional Features](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part2-32.png)

> In that case, log on to your **SAP Cloud Platform mobile service for development and operations** account at `https://hcpms-<your_user_id>trial.dispatcher.hanatrial.ondemand.com/` and navigate to **Mobile Applications > Native/Hybrid**. Select one of the available application configurations and delete in order for the SDK Assistant to add the new application configuration.

<!--
NB: In some cases the loading of the metadata fails, and a dialog will open asking you to import the metadata manually:

![Upload metadata.xml file](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part2-13.png)

In order to upload the metadata file, you need to download it first. Open a browser to the aforementioned metadata URL `https://sapdevsdd27584c4.us2.hana.ondemand.com/codejam/wwdc/services/DeliveryService.xsodata/$metadata`

![Upload metadata.xml file](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part2-14.png)

From the menu, select **File > Save Page As...** and save the file in **XML text** format locally:

![Upload metadata.xml file](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part2-15.png)

Switch back to the **SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS Assistant**, select the just downloaded `$metadata.xml` file and click **Open**:

![Upload metadata.xml file](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part2-16.png)

The SDK Assistant should now finish gracefully.
-->
[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Examine the generated Xcode Project)]

After the SDK Assistant has finished, **Xcode** will launch and open the just generated `MyDeliveries` project.

![Xcode project overview](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part2-17.png)

The `Main.storyboard` shows split-view setup for the generated Master-Detail views.

Folder `MyDeliveries/Onboarding` contains logic for the user on-boarding, authentication and handling of pass-codes and Touch ID.

Folder `Proxy Classes` contains the OData proxy classes generated from the OData service. File `DeliveryService.swift` acts as a data service provider to gain access to the OData entities. The two files `PackagesType.swift` and `DeliveryStatusType.swift` are classes for the OData entities `Packages` and `DeliveryStatus`, respectively. These classes give access to the various properties of the OData entities.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 9: ](Build and run the generated application)]

Click the **Run** button to build and run the generated application:

![Build and run](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part2-18.png)

The **Simulator** app now launches. If you have configured the app to allow for push notifications, you will get the following pop-up:

![Build and run](fiori-ios-scpms-deliveryapp-part2-19.png)

Press **Allow** and click the blue **Start** button.

The **SAML** login screen of **SAP Cloud Platform mobile service for development and operations** is shown. Enter your login credentials for the SAP Cloud Platform and press the **Log On** button:
