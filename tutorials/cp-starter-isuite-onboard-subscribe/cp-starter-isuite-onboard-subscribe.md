## Details

-	How to subscribe to the service and assign user roles
-	How to provision and activate the capabilities

SAP Integration Suite combines the integration capabilities such as Cloud Integration (Process Integration), API Management, Integration Advisor, and Open Connectors into a cohesive and simplified toolkit for enterprise integrations. To provide a comprehensive integration experience, these services are not available separately, but only as part of the Integration Suite service plan.

The Integration Suite includes all integration capabilities in simple service plans. To know more on these plans, see [Integration Suite](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/#/serviceCatalog/f810c887-8d25-4942-9849-354837951066) service catalog.

This part of the series lets you experience few capabilities offered by SAP Integration Suite. For the complete series, see [Request Product Details with an Integration Scenario](mission.cp-starter-integration-cpi.html).

> **IMPORTANT**: Trial accounts are not intended for productive usage or team development. See: [Trial Scope](https://help.sap.com/viewer/51ab953548be4459bfe8539ecaeee98d/sap.cp.integration.suite/en-US/5cc6987511104c418b7cb4c25f3d9cb0.html). If you're using Integration Suite from a production account for your proof of concepts or real-time business cases, refer to the [product documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/51ab953548be4459bfe8539ecaeee98d/sap.cp.integration.suite/en-US/3dcf507f92f54597bc203600bf8f94c5.html) on SAP Help Portal for step-by-step explanation of the initial set up and further information.


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](The Use Case)]

Using this scenario, you design and execute an integration flow that reads product details from a public product catalog (`WebShop`) for a given product identifier. Product details include data such as the product name and price, for example. To accomplish the scenario, you use SAP Integration Suite, and in particular, its capabilities *Cloud Integration* and *API Management*.

You use *Cloud Integration* to design and deploy an integration flow. When you have finished designing, you use the API Explorer tool of *API Management* to expose the integration flow endpoint as an API.

  - You also define how to access the API in terms of authentication by assigning a dedicated predefined policy template.
  - Using this policy template, you define API access based on the OAuth client credentials grant method.
  - Finally, you use API Management to call the API and get the product details in a response.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Enter your trial account)]

>**WHERE TO START**: If you have already activated Cloud Integration (Process Integration) or API Management services in your existing trial account, we recommend you to perform one of the following options:

> **Option 1**: If you are unable to activate **`Integration Suite`** service in an existing subaccount, create a **`New Subaccount`** and then proceed to **Step 3**. For a new subaccount, you need to assign entitlements by adding service plans and the quotas. For more information, see [Configure Entitlements and Quotas for Subaccounts](https://help.sap.com/viewer/ea72206b834e4ace9cd834feed6c0e09/Cloud/en-US/c90f3d522ee04e65bd87cdec8808e5ce.html).

> **Option 2**: To continue with the same subaccount, unsubscribe from Cloud Integration and API Management services, and then proceed to **Step 3**.

> If you are new to SAP BTP or Integration Suite, continue with the tutorial.


1. In your web browser, open the [SAP BTP trial cockpit](https://cockpit.hanatrial.ondemand.com/).

2. Navigate to the trial global account by clicking **Enter Your Trial Account**.
