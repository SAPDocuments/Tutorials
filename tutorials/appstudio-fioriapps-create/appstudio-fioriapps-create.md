1. Access the space to where the app is deployed and go to the **Applications** tab.

    !![Application's space](10-01 SCP Space Applications_.jpg)

2. Make sure your application is in **Started** state, and  click its name (`fioridemo_approuter`). The **`Application: fioridemo_approuter - Overview`** page opens.

3. Right-click the URL under **Application Routes** and save the URL in a text file.

    !![Get application base URL](10-03 SCP Space Application URL_.jpg)

4. Locate the `sap.app id` from the `manifest.json` file located in your HTML5 module, and add it to the copied link after removing the periods.

    !![app id from manifest](10-04 AppStudio SAP Fiori Project Manifest_.jpg)

    > For future reference, this is the construct of the final URL: `<URL_from_application_overview_page>/<mynamespace><project_name>/index.html`.

    >Example: `https://SUBACCOUNT-SPACE-fioridemo-approuter.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/nsBusinessPartners/index.html`

    You can use this URL in any browser to access your new application.
