[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Get Your Twitter API Credentials)]

To generate the word map, you require the proper Twitter credentials (listed below). Set up the credentials on the [Twitter Applications](https://apps.twitter.com) page.

    * Twitter username
    * Consumer Key
    * Consumer Secret
    * Access Key
    * Access Secret

You need these values for the next step.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Modify Python Script)]

In the `HANATweetsAnalysis.py` script, edit the following section to include your Twitter API credentials:

```
TWEET_USERNAME = "tweet_username"
CONSUMER_KEY = "consumer_key"
CONSUMER_SECRET =  "consumer_secret"
ACCESS_KEY = "access_key"
ACCESS_SECRET = "access_secret"
```

Here is an example:

```
TWEET_USERNAME = "SAPInMemory"
CONSUMER_KEY = "Thisismyconsumerkey123"
CONSUMER_SECRET =  "Thisismyconsumersecret123"
ACCESS_KEY = "Thisismyaccesskey123"
ACCESS_SECRET = "Thisismyaccesssecret123"
```

Edit the following section to include your SAP HANA, express edition installation information:

```
HANA_HOST = "hana_host"
HANA_PORT = "hana_port"
HANA_USER = "hana_user"
HANA_PASSWORD = "hana_password"
```

Here is an example:

```
HANA_HOST = "my.HANA.host"
HANA_PORT = "39013"
HANA_USER = "SYSTEM"
HANA_PASSWORD = "HXEHana1"
```

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Execute the Project)]

To run the project, go to **Debug** at the top of the window. Click **Start Without Debugging**. A command prompt window opens and executes the program.

After a few moments, the word map for your Twitter account displays.
