## Details
### You will learn
You will create a SAP Fiori Launchpad on SAP Cloud Platform, which provides access to an application you will develop later. Acting as SAP Cloud Platform administrator, you first prepare the Portal Service inside your SAP Cloud Platform trial account and then add a first test application (SAP Web IDE) to a new launchpad with two groups, Product Management and Equipment Tracking.

### Time to Complete
**30 Mins**

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1:](Enable Portal Service in trial account)]

In SAP S/4HANA, the Fiori Launchpad is your central entry point for all sorts of SAP Fiori apps. You may operate a launchpad on-premises, or you might make use of the SAP Cloud Platform Portal service, which allows you to host the launchpad in your SAP Cloud Platform account. The Launchpad offers features such as navigation, personalization, and configuration options. The apps are displayed as various tiles and groups.

Administrators must first set up their SAP Cloud Platform account prior to working in SAP Fiori launchpad. In this step you will set up the Portal Service in your SAP CP Trial Account.

1.  In Google Chrome browser open the SAP CP Trial cockpit page in a new tab.

2.  Open the **Services** pane and enter query string **portal** in the search field. Click the **Portal Service** tile to enter the admin page.

3.  Press the **Enable** button to provide a Portal to your SAP CP trial account.

    ![SAP CP Cockpit 2](./images/w2-u4-s1/pic02-hcpcockpit-enable-portalservice.png)

    After few seconds a green icon indicates the enabled SAP CP Portal service.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2:](Create new launchpad site)]

Before end users can work in an SAP Fiori launchpad, you as administrator must first set it up by configuring a new launchpad site with content such as app tiles, tile groups, catalogs, and roles that act as the building blocks of a launchpad.

To create a new `launchpad site` in the Site Directory of SAP HANA Cloud Portal apply the following steps:

1.  Choose **Create New Site**.

    ![Portal Service 1](./images/w2-u4-s2/pic01-portalservice-create-new-site.png)

2.  Choose **SAP Fiori Launchpad** as template and enter **Procurement Launchpad** in input field `Site Name`.

    ![Portal Service 2](./images/w2-u4-s2/pic02-portalservice-create-site-form.png)

3.  Choose **Create**.

    ![Portal Service 3](./images/w2-u4-s2/pic02-portalservice-create-site-form-create.png)

Another browser tab gets opened with the `Fiori Configuration Cockpit` for the new launchpad site **Procurement Launchpad**.

![Portal Service 4](./images/w2-u4-s2/pic03-portalservice-procurement-launchpad-fcctab.png)

> **Result:**  You added a new launchpad site with name **Procurement Launchpad** to the Site Directory of SAP HANA Cloud Portal. In the browser tab where you added the new launchpad site it gets displayed as a new tile.
