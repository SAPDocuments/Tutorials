[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Overview)]
In case you want to expose developed ABAP services for technical communication, you are expected to bundle them into a Communication Scenario. This Communication Scenario can then be consumed as a whole by different Communication Systems, represented by Communication Users. The combination of a Scenario, a System and a User is represented by a Communication Arrangement.
