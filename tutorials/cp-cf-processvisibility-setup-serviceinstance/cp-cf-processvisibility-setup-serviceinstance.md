  - How to create a service instance of SAP Cloud Platform Process Visibility using SAP Cloud Platform cockpit

SAP Cloud Platform Process Visibility provides end-to-end visibility and intelligence to processes, which run on cloud, on-premise, and in hybrid environments. For more information on SAP Cloud Platform Process Visibility, refer to [SAP Cloud Platform Process Visibility](https://help.sap.com/viewer/62fd39fa3eae4046b23dba285e84bfd4/Cloud/en-US/2f72882f457a4b87a054bdf45d85fe52.html).

You must create a service instance to enable SAP Cloud Platform Process Visibility. You can create multiple service instances of process visibility across different spaces within the same organization. These instances share the same data.
