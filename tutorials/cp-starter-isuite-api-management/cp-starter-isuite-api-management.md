## Prerequisites
 - You have provisioned your SAP Cloud Platform Integration Suite tenant and activated **Design, Develop and Operate Integration Scenarios** and **Design, Develop and Manage APIs**. For more information, see [Set Up Integration Suite Trial](cp-starter-isuite-onboard-subscribe).
 - You have created and deployed an integration flow that reads product details using an OData connection. For more information, see [Design and Deploy Your First Integration Flow](cp-starter-integration-cpi-design-iflow).

## Details
### You will learn
  - How to create a service instance and key
  - How to define and expose an integration flow endpoint as an API
  - How to assign a policy to the API
  - How to call the API and execute the integration flow using the API portal



In this tutorial, you will define the endpoint of the integration flow developed in the last tutorial as an application programming interface (API).

In addition, you will assign a policy template to the API to define how the API is called. A policy defines, for example, how an API can be called. In this tutorial, you assign a policy that defines an authentication of the API according to OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant. It is a secure way to control access to an API.

After you have performed these steps, you can use the Design, Develop and Manage APIs capability of Integration Suite to finally call the API to fetch the product details.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create service instance and key)]
A service instance defines how a service of SAP Cloud Platform (in our case, the Cloud Integration runtime) can be called from a remote component. In the context of SAP Cloud Platform Integration, a service instance is the definition of an OAuth client. The service key generated out of the service instance contains credentials and other information that is required at a later step to call the integration flow.

1. Navigate back to your SAP Cloud Platform's subaccount and access your subaccount's space by choosing **Spaces** > **dev**. If you have intentionally specified any other space name, you can choose the space of your choice.

    !![Access space](1.1.access-space.png)

2. Choose **Services** > **Service Marketplace** > **Process Integration Runtime**.

    >**TIP:** If you do not see the **Process Integration Runtime** service in the list, at the subaccount level, choose **Entitlements** > **Configure Entitlements** > **Add Service Plans**. Choose **Process Integration Runtime** and select the **integration-flow** service plan checkbox and choose **Add 1 Service Plan**.

    !![Access PI Runtime](1.2.access-process-integration-runtime.png)

3. Select **Create Instance**.

    !![Create new instance](1.3.create.new.instance.png)

4. Select the following details and choose **Next**.

    |  Field Name     | Details
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  **Service**           | **`Process Integration Runtime`**
    |  **Service Plan**           | Select **`integration-flow`** from the dropdown list
    |  **Instance Name**    | Enter **`Test`** or name of your choice

      !![New instance wizard](1.4.create.new.instance.png)

5. In the **Specify Parameters** tab, enter the following **`JSON`** code snippet:
    ```JSON
    {
     "roles":[
       "ESBMessaging.send"
     ]
    }
    ```
    !![Jsoncode](1.5.Jsoncode.png)

    Choose **Next** > **Create Instance**.

    !![finalstep](1.5.CreateInstancefinal.png)

6. Upon successful creation of an instance, a dialog opens. Choose **View Instance**.

    !![view instances](1.6.viewinstance.png)

7. Select the newly created **Service Instance**, click **Actions** (ellipsis button at the right top corner) and choose **Create Service Key** to create a new service key.

    !![Select service key](1.7.select-service-instance.png)

    You create this service instance to enable inbound HTTP calls to your SAP Cloud Platform Integration tenant.

    >**TIP**: This service key will provide you the credentials for making inbound HTTP calls to integration flows deployed on your SAP Cloud Platform Integration Suite tenant. You use the credentials of the service key that is `clientid` and `clientsecret` to call an integration flow as an HTTP endpoint. For more information, see [Setting Up Basic Inbound Authentication with `clientId` and `clientsecret` from a Service Key](https://help.sap.com/viewer/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/Cloud/en-US/647eeb3eca5d4c299009cacd1332247e.html).

8. Specify a name for the service key and choose **Create**.

    !![Enter service key name](1.8.create-service-key-2.png)

9. Choose **Actions** (ellipsis button) and then **View**.

      !![view key](1.9.key_view.png)

10. Copy the values of **`clientid`**, **`clientsecret`** and **`tokenurl`** parameters. These are the credentials that you use to make a request to your integration flow.

      !![Copy clientid and clientsecret](1.10.copy-clientid-secret.png)

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Define the API)]
In this step, you define and expose an integration flow endpoint as an application programming interface

1. Go to your SAP Cloud Platform trial subaccount. Select **Subscriptions**. On the **Integration Suite tile**, select **Go to Application**.

    !![AccessIsuite](3.1.AccesstoIsuite.png)

2. On the Integration Suite welcome page, click **Design, Develop and Manage APIs**.

    !![API management](3.2.WelcomePageIsuite.png)

3. On the home page, under **Quick Actions** click **API**.

    !![QuickactionsAPI](003.png)

4. On the **Create API** dialog, next to **Select**: choose **URL** and specify the following parameters:
>**IMPORTANT** : Copy only the endpoint URL till **`/http/products`** Otherwise, the scenario will not run appropriately.

    |  Parameter    | Settings
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  URL           | Paste the integration flow endpoint address you have copied in **step 2**. It ends with **`/http/products/details`**. **Note:** copy only the endpoint URL till **`/http/products`** instead of **`/http/products/details`**.
    |  Name           | **`RequestProductDetails`**
    |  Title    | **`Product Details API`**
    |  API Base Path          | **`/products`**

    !![Link text e.g., Destination screen](004.png)
    Select **Create**.

5. On the landing page, select tile **Resources**.

6. Select **Add**.

    !![Add resources](006.png)

7. In field **Tag** enter **`Product Details`**, and in field **Path Prefix** enter **`/details`**.  

    !![Add details](007.png)

8. Under **Operations**, delete all tabs except the **POST** tab and click **OK**.

    !![Add operations](008.png)

    The API Resource is displayed.

9. Select **Deploy** to create and activate the API Proxy for your integration flow.

    !![Deploy](009.png)

10. Click the **POST** operation to display more details on the API. A default API definition in Open API specification format is also generated.

11. To update the generated API definition in Open API format, select **Edit > Edit in API Designer**.

    !![Edit API designer](010.png)

    The API designer is opened.

12. In the editable section on the right part of the screen, make the following changes.

    Change **Payload** to **`productIdentifier`** and add a row as shown in the following screenshot.

    >**TIP**: Instead of copying the example, type it manually.

    !![change product identifier](011.png)

    Select **Save**. You are navigated to the APIs list view.

13. To view or edit your API Proxy changes, click the name of the API **`RequestProductDetails`**.

    !![RequestProductDetails](012.png)

14. Go to tab **Resources**, and click the **POST** request.

    !![ResourcesTab](013.png)

    You notice the API changes, in particular, the request body contains now one element with a product identifier.

    !![ResourcesTabAPI Changes](014.png)

15. When you click **Try Out** and then **Execute**, since no authentication details have been configured, you get an error message with error code 401 (not authorized).

    !![Error message](015.png)

    With this step, you have successfully created an API Proxy for your integration flow and generated an API documentation for your REST APIs in **`OpenAPI`** format.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Assign policy template)]
With this step, you assign a policy template to your API to specify authentication details for the API call. In particular, you use a policy template that defines that the caller of the API authenticates itself using OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant.

This grant type works in the following way: In a first call, the API client provides the values of **`clientid`** and **`clientsecret`** (from the service key generated in Step 1) to a token service (the URL of the token service is also contained in the service key definition). The token service provides an access token to the API client. In a subsequent call, the API client calls the integration flow endpoint providing the access token. If the access token is valid, the API client is authorized to call the integration flow.

1. In API Portal, in the navigation area, navigate to section **Discover**.

    !![Discover](016.png)

2. In the search field, Search for **Connect to SAP Cloud Platform services** and Choose package **Connect to SAP Cloud Platform services**.

    !![choose API](017.png)

3. Navigate to **Artifacts** tab.

    !![Artifacts1](018.png)

4. Under **Actions**, select **Copy**.

    !![Actions](019.png)

5. After a success message is displayed, select section **Develop**.

    !![Develop API](020.png)

6. Select your API proxy.

    !![API Proxy](021.png)

7. Choose **Edit**.

    !![EDit](022.png)

8. Select **Policies**.

    !![Policies ](023.png)

    The Policy Editor opens.

9. Choose **Policy Template --> Apply**.

    !![Policy Template](024.png)

10. Select the template **`Cloud_Platform_Connectivity`** and click **Apply**.

    !![add Template](025.png)

11. Open the node **Target Endpoint**.

    !![TargetEndPoint](026.png)

12. Click **`PreFlow`**.

    !![PreFlow](027.png)

13. In the editor, the OAuth workflow defined by the policy is visualized as a graphical model.

    Now, you need the content of the service key generated in Step 1: Create service instance and key. Open another browser tab and display the service key.

    You need the values of **`clientid`**, **`clientsecret`** and **`tokenurl`**.

14. In the graphical model of the **Policy Editor**, click the **`getcredential`** shape.

    !![Graphic Model](028.png)

15. Paste the value of **`clientid`** and **`clientsecret`** as shown in the following image.

    !![Values](029.png)

16. In the Policy Editor, click the **`getoauthtoken`** shape.

    !![token](030.png)

17. Paste the value of **`tokenurl`** as shown in the following screenshot.

    !![tokenURL](031.png)

18. Select **Update**.

    !![tokenURL](032.png)

19. Select **Save**.

    !![Save](033.png)

    In this step you have assigned a policy template.

[VALIDATE_7]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Execute API)]

In this step you try out the API to get product details as a response from the remote component.

1. Go to the **Resources tab**.

    !![ResourceTab](034.png)

2. Click **Try Out**.

    !![try out](035.png)

3. Click **Execute**.

    !![Execute](036.png)

4. As result, you see the response from the **`WebShop`** with the product details for the given product identifier.
