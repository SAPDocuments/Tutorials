[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Understand MultiChain on SAP Cloud Platform)]

The MultiChain service on SAP Cloud Platform lets you create, delete, monitor, and maintain individual MultiChain nodes and then connect them to a blockchain network.

This service is supported by Small, Medium, Large, and Connect Your Own Network productive service plans.

In addition to productive service plans, we also offer a Trial service plan on the trial landscape. This plan comes with the following conditions:

- One trial service instance per SAP Cloud Platform Global Account

- MultiChain Service instances expire after 14 days, including the loss of the blockchain data (if not synced to a wider network), wallet data (public and private keys), and external IP addresses used to connect to other nodes.

- An existing service instance, whether expired or not, must be deleted before a new service instance can be provisioned within the Global Account.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Create MultiChain instance)]

Once in the MultiChain service, you will see a service description and the available plans. In this tutorial you will create a trial node. This allows you to provision a single testing node for a 14 day period. These 14 days run concurrently with your 30-day global account trial on SAP Cloud Platform, rather than activating an extension or superseding your global account trial terms.

Click the **Instances** tab on the side menu, opening an overview of available MultiChain instances in your subaccount.
