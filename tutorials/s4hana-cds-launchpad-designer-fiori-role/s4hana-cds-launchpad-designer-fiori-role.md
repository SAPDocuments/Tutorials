2. From the above welcome page, click on the link (1) to access the Login screen of the Fiori Launchpad Designer.
    ![Launchpad2](Lauchnpad2.png)
Start the Fiori Launchpad Logon and logon to the preconfigured system with:
 (1) User:     `S4H`
 (2) Password: `Welcome1`
 (3) Client:   `100`
and afterwards(4) click on Log On button.

3. Now you have to append the `url` to the Fiori Launchpad Designer to SAP Launchpad `url`. The part that needs to be appended to the `url` is this:
`/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/arsrvc_upb_admn/main.html`

    ![Launchpad3](Lauchnpad3.png)
Afterwards hit the Enter taste from your keyboard.
We are now able to see lots of tiles because new profiles were already assigned to the user S4H.
