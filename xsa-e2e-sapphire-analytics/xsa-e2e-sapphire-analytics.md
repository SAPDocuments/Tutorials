[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Contribute to the pool of Big Data)]

In Google Chrome, you will find a tab with a Google sheet. If it is not already open, open it using the bookmark in the favorite bar.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Create a database module)]

**Right-click** on the project and select **New > SAP HANA Database Module**.

![New DB module](8.png)

Call the module `hana` and click **Next**.

![New DB module](9.png)

Flag **Build module after creation** and click **Finish**.

![New DB module](10.png)

Once the module has been created, expand it, right-click the `src` folder and choose **Import > File or Project**.

![New DB module](11.png)

Use **Browse** to navigate to `Desktop\1-HANA Data Import` and choose the file called `src (analytics).zip`.

![New DB module](12.png)

Delete `src (analytics)` from the path and click **OK**.

![New DB module](13.png)

In the next dialog, confirm overwriting the files.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Load data into the tables)]

Open the Google sheet again and copy the data into the clipboard.

![New DB module](15.png)

Go back into SAP Web IDE for SAP HANA and double-click the file `responses.csv` to open it. Then use **Ctrl+V** to paste the contents of the survey.

![New DB module](16.png)

**Save** the file.

Right-click the `hana` module and choose **Build** from the contextual menu.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Create a Text Analysis model)]

Right-click the folder `src` and choose **New > Calculation View**.

![New TA CV](cv.png)

Call it `TEXT_ANALYTICS` and click **OK**.

![New TA CV](18.png)

Click **Aggregation** node and then the **+** sign to add a new data source.

![New TA CV](19png.png)

Enter `respon` to find the set of responses you loaded. Choose the result starting with `$TA` and click **Finish**.

![New TA CV](20.png)

Expand the detail panel and double-click the column `TA_TOKEN` to transfer it to the results. Click `Calculated Columns`.

![New TA CV](21.png)

Use the **+** icon to create a new counter.

![New TA CV](22.png)

Click the counter to edit the details.

![New TA CV](counter.png)

Choose column `TA_TOKEN` for the counter.

![New TA CV](23.png)

Save and build the new view.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Preview the Text Analysis model)]

Once the build is finished, right-click again and choose **Data Preview**.

![Data preview](25.png)

Drag and drop `TA_TOKEN` to both the `Label` and the `Value` axis. Choose the donut to visualize your results.

> ### Congratulations!
> You have a preview of the most used words so far.
> These models can be consumed by different visualization tools, such as SAP `Lumira` or SAP Analytics Cloud, to produce advanced visualizations.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Anonymize the data)]

Create a new calculation view by right-clicking on the `src` folder and choosing **New > Calculation View**.

![New view](27.png)

Call it `ANONYMIZE` and click **Create**.

![New view](28.png)

Click the `anonymize` data node and then click the white modelling area to drop it.

![New view](29.png)

Use the **+** sign to incorporate data into the model.

![New view](31.png)

Type `respon` and choose the result starting with `SAPPHIRE` and ending with `RESPONSE_DATA`.

![New view](32.png)

Use the button to expand details and double-click the data source to transfer the field to the results.

![New view](33.png)

Then click **Details**. Configure the anonymity algorithm as follows:

- `Sequence Column`: **ID**
- `k`: **2**
- `Quasi Columns`: Use the **+** sign to choose column `ORIGIN_COUNTRY`

![New view](34.png)

Use the arrow on the anonymity column to configure the values.

![New view](35.png)

Type in a higher level of `anonymization` for the countries.

Click **Back** when you are finished.

![New view](36.png)

Drag and drop the arrow on the `anonymization` node into the aggregation node.

![New view](drag.gif)

Click the aggregation node and double-click the root data source to transfer the columns to the output.

![New view](37.png)

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 9: ](Preview the anonymization)]

Save and build the calculation view.

![Data preview](38.png)

Once the build has finished, right-click and choose **Data Preview**.

![Data preview](39.png)

Click **Raw data** and you will see the values for the countries have been replaced


> ### Why is this useful?
> `Anonymization` of data helps companies protect privacy and comply with data protection regulations, such as GDPR, together with many other measures to mask data that could potentially identify an individual.
>&nbsp;
> In this example, there are single combinations of job roles in specific countries. In other words, if the lucky number was sensitive information such as the salary and somebody knew who filled in the spreadsheet, they could deduce an individual's salary because of the unique combination of job role and country.
