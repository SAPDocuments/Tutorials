[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create and run the project)]
Open **Android Studio**.

![Android Studio](android-studio.png)


Choose **Start a new SAP Cloud Platform Android project**.

![New project](new-project.png)


The wizard can save the server connection details for multiple servers. Fill in the required fields as shown below.
>Ensure you have completed the prerequisites for this tutorial before continuing.

| Field | Value |
|----|----|
| Account Name | `SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services Trial` |
| Admin API URL | See below for how to get this URL |
| Admin UI URL | See below for how to get this URL |
| Username | Username for your trial account user |
| Password | Password for your trial account user |
| Save Account Information | Check the first time the account info so it does not have to be re-entered on subsequent runs of the wizard |

Go to the SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services website and under **Important Links**, both URLs will be present

![Admin API and UI URL](admin-url.png)

![Server connection](server-connection.png)

Click **Next** on the **Server Connection** tab.


On the **Cloud Configuration** tab select **Create** and provide the required information.

| Field | Value |
|----|----|
| Application Name | `Wiz App` |
| Application ID | `com.sap.wizapp` |
| Authentication Type | `Basic` |

![Create tab information](create-application-wizard.png)

Click **Next** to configure the OData Services.


![OData services blank](odata-services-blank.png)

The SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services provides a sample backend destination named `com.sap.edm.sampleservice.v2` that is being used here to provide data for the application. It contains product categories, product, supplier, customer and sales order data. Since you are creating a new application, add `com.sap.edm.sampleservice.v2`.

![OData services add service](odata-services-add.png)

Click **Next** to continue to the project configuration.

![OData services done](odata-services.png)


On the **Android Studio Project** tab provide the following configuration data.

| Field | Value |
|----|----|
| Project Name | `Wiz App` |
| Project Namespace | `com.sap.wizapp` |
| Target Language | Java |

![Project configuration](project-configuration.png)


On the Project Features tab, provide the following configuration data.

| Field | Value |
|----|----|
| Use Discovery Service as Configuration Provider | uncheck |
| OData | Online |
| Create a sample user experience for the selected OData Destination | check |
| Enable Logging | check |
| Enable Upload | check |
| Enable Usage | check |
| Enable Push | optional |

![Project features](push-notification-checkbox-enabled.png)

If you would like to add push notification support to your application, proceed to Step 2 which describes how to acquire a `google-services.json` file needed for push messaging.  Otherwise, uncheck Enable Push, click **Finish** and proceed to Step 3.

[VALIDATE_1]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Enable push notifications (optional))]

When the **Enable Push** checkbox is checked, an error message is shown explaining that you need to specify a `google-services.json` file. We will obtain this file from the [Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/) feature in [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

![Push Notifications enabled](push-notification-checkbox-enabled.png)


Open the [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) console and click on **`Add project`**.

![Add project in Firebase](firebase-add-project.png)

Access **`Project Settings`** for the newly created project.  

![Project settings](firebase-project-settings.png)


Add Firebase to your app.

![Add Firebase to your Android app](add-firebase-to-android.png)


The **Android package name** must match the **Project Namespace** used when creating the app in Android Studio. In our example, the **Android package name** is `com.sap.wizapp`.

![Register App](firebase-register-app.png)


Download the **`google-services.json`** file.

![Download google-services.json file](download-google-services-button.png)


Now browse for the **`google-services.json`** file in the wizard. This file is placed into the app folder of the generated project and helps enable the app to work with Google Firebase notifications.

![Add google-services.json file to wizard](wizard-google-services-added.png)

>The push configuration on the server will be added in the tutorial [Send notifications to your application](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-sdk-android-wizard-app-push.html).


Click **Finish**.

[VALIDATE_2]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Explore the app)]
Wait for the build to finish.  

![Project created](project-created.png)

Click the **Run** toolbar icon.

![Run the project](run.png)


Choose the emulator to run the app on.  
>For more information on creating Virtual Devices that run in the Android Emulator, see [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds).

![Deployment target](choose-emulator.png)


The welcome screen is shown the first time the app is run.

![Welcome screen](welcome-screen.png)


Sign in with your credentials.

![Authentication screen](authentication-screen.png)


The entered credentials, are securely stored by the app, and do not need to be re-entered the next time the app is opened.

The passcode (or fingerprint if enabled) screen provides an additional layer of security for your app.  

![Passcode screen](create-passcode.png)

The passcode policy can be modified in the Mobile Service Cockpit under Client Policies feature.  The passcode screen will not be shown if the `Enable Passcode Policy` is not checked.

![Passcode Policy](passcode-policy.png)

As usage reporting was enabled, this screen can be used to show details of how the collected data will be used.  Usage is covered in a later tutorial in this mission.

![Data Collection screen](data-collection-screen.png)


The first screen of the app shows the different entities that are in the sample OData service.

![Entities screen](entities-screen.png)


Tap on **`Products`** to reach the below list screen.

![Products screen](products-screen.png)


Tap on a list item to show an editable detail screen.

Congratulations!  You have created your first Android app using the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for Android!
