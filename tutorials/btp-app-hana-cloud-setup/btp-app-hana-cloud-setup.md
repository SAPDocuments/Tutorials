[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Add SAP HANA Client to Your Project)]

The SAP HANA `hdb` npm module needs to be added to our package to support SAP HANA.

```Shell/Bash
npm install hdb --save
```

The CAP application will still use SQLite in-memory database for local testing, while the SAP HANA database should be used "productively" in the cloud.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Switch to hdbtable Deployment)]

By default, the deployment uses the `hdbcds` as deployment format. However, this isn't supported for SAP HANA Cloud and the configuration needs to be changed to use the `hdbtable` and `hdbview` format.

1. Add the following snippet at the end of your `package.json` in your `cpapp` project:

    <!-- cpes-file package.json:$.cds -->
    ```json hl_lines="4-13"
    {
      "name": "cpapp",
      ...
      "cds": {
        "requires": {
          "db": {
            "kind": "sql"
          }
        },
        "hana": {
          "deploy-format": "hdbtable"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    > - [CAP Configuration](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-env)

2. Run `cds watch` and check that your app still works locally as it used to work before at <http://localhost:4004/>.

6. Choose **SAP HANA Cloud** in the left-hand pane.

    !![SAP HANA Cloud](hana_cloud_empty.png)

7. Choose **Create** **&rarr;** **SAP HANA database**.

8. Sign in with your SAP BTP Cockpit username/email.

9. The **Organization** and **Space** will be selected.

10. Enter the **Instance Name**: `cpapp`.

    !![Create SAP HANA Cloud: Step 1a](hana_cloud_create_1a.png)

11. Enter a password for _DBADMIN_ in **Administrator Password** and **Confirm Administrator Password**.
   
    !![Create SAP HANA Cloud: Step 1b](hana_cloud_create_1b.png)

12. Choose **Step 2**.

13. The default settings should be sufficient for the tutorial application.

    !![Create SAP HANA Cloud: Step 2](hana_cloud_create_2.png)

14. Choose **Step 3**.

15. Choose `Deny all IP addresses (except Business Technology Platform)`.

    !![Create SAP HANA Cloud: Step 3](hana_cloud_create_3.png)
    

16. Choose **Step 4**.

    > You can optional create a SAP HANA [data lake](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9ae9104a46f74a6583ce5182e7fb20cb/hanacloud/en-US/f7febb16072b41f7ac90abf5ea1d4b86.html#loiof7febb16072b41f7ac90abf5ea1d4b86__step_datalake_params). It's really useful for storing and analyzing high volumes of infrequently updated data in a production environment and to adjust how much Compute and Storage space it has, but we don't need it for this tutorial. You can enable or disable the SAP HANA data lake later as well if you prefer.

17. Choose **Step 5**.

    > This step includes advanced SAP HANA data lake settings that are only relevant if you have created a SAP HANA data lake at step 4. You can skip this if you haven't created a SAP HANA data lake.

 
18. Choose **Create Instance**. 

    The creation of the database instance can take some minutes to complete. The final result looks like this in SAP BTP cockpit:
    
    !![SAP HANA Cloud Instance Created](hana_cloud_created.png)
 
    > Your SAP HANA Cloud instance will be automatically stopped overnight, according to the server region time zone. That means you need to restart your instance every day, before you start working with your trial.
