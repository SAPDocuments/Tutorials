[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create new page for new customer record)]

In this step, you will create the `Customers_Create.page` as a **Form Cell Page**. This type of page allows for form input style changes. The page will provide only a subset of items available on the Customer Detail page. You will add the fields that will be editable by the end-user.

1. Right-click the **Pages** folder | **New MDK Page** | **Form Cell Page** | **Next**.

    ![MDK](img_001.1.png)

    >A Form Cell Page is suitable for pages that generate new objects or modify existing objects. It includes a form cell container by default. You can add form sections, multiple containers or action controls to this page. Under each container section, you can add various container items.

    >You can find more details about [Form Cell page](https://help.sap.com/viewer/977416d43cd74bdc958289038749100e/Latest/en-US/a0358d7a9c3b46e0819f28ae779def24.html).

2. Enter the Page Name `Customers_Create` and click **Next** and the **Finish** on the Confirmation step.

    ![MDK](img_002.png)

3. In the **Properties** pane, set the **Caption** to **Create Customer**.

    ![MDK](img_003.png)

      Now, you will add the fields (like first name, last name, phone, email address & date of birth) for creating a new customer record by the end-user.

4. In the Layout Editor, expand the **Control** | **Container Item** section.

    >You can find more details about [available controls in Form Cell page](https://help.sap.com/viewer/977416d43cd74bdc958289038749100e/Latest/en-US/a0358d7a9c3b46e0819f28ae779def24.html).

5. Drag and drop a **Simple Property** onto the Page area.

4. Now, you will set the `onPress` event to `CloseModalPage_Cancel.action`.

    In **Events** tab, click the **link icon** for the `OnPress` property to open the object browser.

    Double click the `CloseModalPage_Cancel.action` and click **OK** to set it as the `OnPress` Action.

    ![MDK](img_015.gif)

5. Save the changes to the `Customers_Create.page`.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Create navigation action)]

Now, create a navigation action that will open the `Customers_Create.page` when executed.

1. Right-click the **Actions** folder | **New MDK Action** | choose **MDK UI Actions** in **Category** | click **Navigation Action** | **Next**.

2. Provide the below information:

    | Property | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Action Name`| `NavToCustomers_Create` |

    | `ModalPage`| check this option |

    ![MDK](img_016.png)

3. Click **Next** and then **Finish** on the confirmation step.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Add create button to customer list page)]

You will add a button to the `Customers_List.page` called **Add**. You will link this button to the navigation action you just created. This event will open the `NavToCustomers_Create.action` when the Add button is pressed by the end-user.

1. In `Customers_List.page`, drag and drop an **Action Bar Item** to the upper right of the action bar.

    ![MDK](img_016_1.gif)

2. Click the **link icon** to open the object browser for the `SystemItem` property.

3. Double click the **Add** type and click **OK**.

4. ![MDK](img_017.png)

    In the Properties pane, click the **Events** tab, click the **link icon** for the `OnPress` property to open the object browser.

5. Double click the `NavToCustomers_Create.action` action and click **OK** to set it as the `OnPress` Action.

    ![MDK](img_019.gif)

6. Save the changes to the `Customers_List.page`.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Store the created data locally)]

The next step is to store newly created record locally for an offline application or send the new record directly back to the backed for online applications. You will now create an action to map the changes received from the `Customers_Create.page` to the corresponding field in the OData service. You will also show a failure message if the create action fails to save the changes.

1. First, define a failure message.

    Right-click the **Actions** folder | **New MDK Action** | choose **MDK Message Actions** in **Category** | click **Message Action** | **Next**.

    ![MDK](img_020.png)

2. Provide the below information:

    | Property | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Action Name`| `CreateCustomerEntityFailureMessage` |
    | `Type` | select `Message` |
    | `Message` | `Failed to Create Customer record` |
    | `Title` | `Create Customer` |
    | `OKCaption` | `OK` |
    | `OnOK` | `--None--` |
    | `CancelCaption` | leave it blank |
    | `OnCancel` | `--None--`|

    ![MDK](img_021.png)

3. Click **Next** and then **Finish** on the Confirmation step.

    Next, you will create the **OData Create action** to update entity action that will map the changes to the correct entities in the OData service and save the changes.

    >You can find more details about [Create Entity Action](https://help.sap.com/viewer/977416d43cd74bdc958289038749100e/Latest/en-US/9cafb37ca8ad49e6930dba857352a3e6.html).

4. Right-click the **Actions** folder | **New MDK Action** | choose **MDK Data Actions** in **Category** | click **OData Action** | **Next**.

    ![MDK](img_023.png)

5. Provide the below information:

    | Property | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Action Name`| `Customers_CreateEntity` |
    | `Type` | `CreateEntity` |
    | `Service`| `SampleServiceV2` |
    | `EntitySet` | `Customers` |

    ![MDK](img_024.png)

6. Click **Next**.

7. In **Property and Create Links** step, uncheck **City**.

    Since in `Customer_Create.page`, we defined five properties (First Name, Last Name, Phone, Email & date of birth) to be added, now in this step, we will bind them to respective UI Controls.

    Check the `DateOfBirth` property and click the **link icon** to open the object browser.

    Change the drop down in the object browser to `Controls & ClientData`, click the **Current Page** radio button.

    In the search box start typing the control name `FCCreateDOB`. The list will filter down to show the matching values. Double click the **Value (Value)** entry under the `FCCreateDOB` field and click **OK** to set binding.

    ![MDK](img_026.gif)

8. Repeat the above step for remaining properties: `EmailAddress`, `FirstName`, `LastName` and `PhoneNumber`.

    ![MDK](img_027.png)

    ![MDK](img_027.1.png)

    Click **Next** and **Finish** on the confirmation screen. The action editor will open with the `Customers_CreateEntity.action` loaded.

      Next, define _Success_ and _Failure_ actions for `Customers_CreateEntity.action`.

9. In the action editor for the new action, expand the **Common Action Properties** and provide the below information:

    | Property | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Success Action` | `CloseModalPage_Complete.action` |
    | `Failure Action` | `CreateCustomerEntityFailureMessage.action` |

    >When `Customers_CreateEntity.action` gets executed successfully then `CloseModalPage_Complete.action` will be triggered or if `Customers_CreateEntity.action` fails then `CreateCustomerEntityFailureMessage.action` will be triggered.

    ![MDK](img_028.png)

10. Save the changes to the `Customers_CreateEntity.action`.

11. Next, you will set the `OnPress` event of the _Save_ button.

    Now, that the Create action is created, you will need to call the Create action when the end-user presses the **Save** button. You will add a **Save** button on the `Customers_Create.page` and link it to the `Customers_CreateEntity.action`.

    In `Customers_Create.page`, **drag and drop** an **Action Bar Item** to the upper right corner of the action bar.

    ![MDK](img_029.png)

12. Click the **link** icon to open the object browser for the **System Item** property.

    Double click the **Save** type and click **OK**.

    ![MDK](img_030.png)

    In the Properties pane | **Events** tab, click the **link** icon for the `OnPress` property to open the object browser, bind it to `Customers_CreateEntity.action`.

    ![MDK](img_031.png)

13. Save the changes to the `Customers_Create.page`.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Deploy and activate the application)]

Deploy the updated application to your MDK client.

1. Right-click the `DemoSampleApp` MDK Application in the project explorer pane and select **MDK Deploy and Activate**.

    ![MDK](img_026.1.png)

2. Since we have deployed already both the destination and app id should be pre-selected based on the last time you deployed our application.  Confirm the **Destination Name** is `mobileservices_cf` and the **Application Id** is `com.sap.mdk.demo` and click **Next**.

    ![MDK](img_014.1.png)
