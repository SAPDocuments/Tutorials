>What are spaces? The concept of Spaces and Organizations were introduced as of SPS12. Spaces are meant to group common resources and different applications that can access them. When an application is deployed into a space, it has access to existing user authorizations or data storage created within that space. A space belongs in an organization, together with other spaces.
