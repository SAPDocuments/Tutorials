## Prerequisites
 - You've already created the `JobCore` Portal site.  


## Details
### You will learn
  - How to add an existing SAPUI5 app to your Portal site.

In this tutorial, you're going to add an SAPUI5 app to your Portal site.  


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Open Content Manager)]

 Click the **Content Manager** icon in the left panel of the Site Manager.

>The Content Manager is where you manage the business content items for your subaccount: apps, catalogs, groups, and roles. These business content items can be used in any Portal site in your subaccount.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create and configure new app)]

1.  Click **+ New** and select **App** from the list.

    ![Add an app](2-add-app.png)

    The App editor opens on the **PROPERTIES** tab.

2. Enter the following values:

    * **Title**: `New Orders`

    * **Open App**: In place

    * **URL**:  `https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/m/demokit/cart/webapp/index.html`

    !![Enter app properties](3-add-app-properties.png)

    >When working in your own environment, it is better to integrate SAPUI5 apps by configuring a destination to the relevant system and setting the app properties to use this destination. In this case in the  **App UI Technology** dropdown list, you would select `SAPUI5`. This configuration allows you to better manage your content in the Dev-QA-Prod lifecycle.

3. Click the **NAVIGATION** tab to specify the intent of your app.

    > The unique combination of a semantic object and an action is called an intent. It is used to define navigation to an application.

4. Enter the following values:

    * **Semantic Object**: `Order`

    * **Action**: `Display`

    !![Add navigation properties](4-navigation-properties.png)

5. Click the **VISUALIZATION** tab.

    In this tab, you specify how the app will be displayed in the launchpad.

6. Enter the following values:

      * **Subtitle**: `Shopping Cart `

      * **Information**:  `Order Now!`

      * **Icon**: Click the browse icon, type `my-sales-order`, click on the displayed icon, and click **OK**.

      On the right, you can see a preview of the tile with all the properties you entered.
      Click **Save**.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](View the app that you created)]

Click the Content Manager icon in the left side panel of the App editor to navigate to the top level of your configured content.

  !![Go back to Content Manager](6-back-to-content-manager.png)

You can see your app in the list:

!![View app in content manager list](7-view-app.png)

For end users to access the app in runtime, you must assign the app to a role. Any end user who is a member of this role will be able to access the app. In this tutorial, we use the `Everyone` role. All users are members of the `Everyone` role. You also need to assign the app to a group so that it's visible in the launchpad page.

This is described in the following steps.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Assign the app to the Everyone role)]

In this step you'll assign the app to the `Everyone` role.

>Content assigned to the `Everyone` role is visible to all users.

1. Click the Content Manager icon and select the **Everyone** role.

    !![Select everyone role](10-everyone-role.png)

2. Click **Edit**.

    ![Click Edit](11-edit.png)

3. In the Role editor, in the **Assignments** panel, type `Or` to search for your app.

4. In the **Results** list, click the + icon next to your `New Orders` app to assign this role to your app.

    !![Assign role to app](12-assign-role.png)

5. Click **Save**.

6. Click the Content Manager icon to navigate back to the top level of your content.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Create a group and assign the app to it)]

In this step, you will create a new group and assign your app to it.

>A group is a set of one or more apps displayed together in the launchpad.
 Assigning apps to groups allows users to view them in the launchpad page.

1. In the Content Manager, click **+ New** and select **Group** to open the Group editor.

    !![Add a new group](8-add-group.png)

2. Enter `Purchasing` as the **Title** and in the **Assignments** panel on the upper right of the screen, type in the first two letters of your app (in this case it will be `Ne`), to search for your app. You should see `New Orders`.

3. In the **Results** list, click + to assign this app to your group.

    !![Configure group properties](9-configure-group.png)

4. Click **Save**.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]



[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Review the site)]

1. Click the Site Directory icon in the left panel.

    !![Open Content Manager](13-open-content-manager.png)

2. On the `JobCore Portal` tile in the Site Directory, click the **Go to site** icon:

    !![Go to site](14-go-to-site.png)

3. This is what you'll see:

    !![View site](15-view-site.png)

    Your `New Orders` app is displayed in the `Purchasing` group.

4. Click the `New Orders` tile to launch the app. You can click on the different items in the opened app on the left to view their details.

You've added an app to your Portal site. In the next tutorial, you'll add another app.
