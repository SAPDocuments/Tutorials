    > Start context will be filled as you have defined the same in workflow properties while enhancing sample workflow application from `Web IDE`. This start context is valid only if you have configured `SuccessFactors` system.

    >If you have not configured `SuccessFactors` destination in setup tutorial, then replace the default context with the following code. This is the sample employee information as fetched from `SuccessFactors`. Make sure you enter your SAP Cloud Platform trial user email ID as `buddyId` and `managerId` in the end.
