## Details
SAP Jam is SAP's cloud-based social platform for collaboration. It delivers secure collaboration in your working environment. In the case of the `ESPM` application, by integrating SAP Jam, customer reviews can be grouped into different categories to allow their better and faster analysis. Customers can write reviews and rate the products. This product reviews information can be fetched from within SAP Cloud Platform into SAP Jam. The admin can then analyze the data and receive information on top-rated products, bottom-rated products, etc. By using SAP Jam for collaboration, product managers and sales team can work together in order to analyze this information and optimize their strategy.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Import the ESPM Web Shop Records into SAP Jam)]

Record types in SAP Jam define how the data from the external application will be displayed within SAP Jam.

1. Import the Product Records

    a. From the **External Applications** page, select **Action** > **Manage Record Types** next to the `ESPM` application.

    b. Click on the **Add Record Type** button.

    c. In the **Name** text box, enter `Products`.

    d. In the **External Type** text box enter `https://espmxxxxxxxtrial.hanatrial.ondemand.com/espm-cloud-web/` and add `espm.svc/$metadata#Products`.
 This data includes the information on the products included in the `ESPM` application. It is exposed as OData.

    e. In the **Annotation URL** text box enter `https://espmxxxxxxxtrial.hanatrial.ondemand.com/espm-cloud-web/webshop/` and add `reviews_annotations.xml`.
    This file is used by SAP Jam to render the data.

    The `annotations.xml` file, together with the available data, exposed via OData, enables you to create an external application in SAP Jam that brings in products and product reviews data from the `ESPM` application into SAP Jam. The OData annotations file specifies how each type of data is displayed in a specified UI element.

    f. Select the **Import External Resources** button. A success page will be displayed. Choose **Done**.
