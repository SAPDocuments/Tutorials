    b. Choose **Clone or Download**, and copy the URL. You can click ![Git-Clone-or-Download](Git_Clone.png) ( **Copy to clipboard** ).

2. Clone the Git repository in Eclipse.

    a. In Eclipse, select **Window** > **Perspective** > **Open Perspective** > **Other**.

    b. Select **Git** and click **OK** to open the **Git** perspective.

    c. From the **Git Repositories** view on the left select **Clone a Git repository**.

    As you already copied the `cloud-espm-v2` Git repository URL to your clipboard, the URI, Host, Repository path and Protocol fields are automatically filled.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Import and Build the Maven Project)]

The following steps describe how you can import and then update the Maven project (which fixes any Maven and POM dependency-related issues). Then you will build the Maven project in Eclipse.

    a. In Eclipse, switch back to the **Java EE** perspective and go to **File > Import**.

    b. From the Import box that appears select **Maven > Existing Maven projects** and choose **Next**.

    c. Specify the root directory of the application (usually Git stores its information in your user folder, then a folder named "git" and then under a folder with the application name), then choose **Finish**.

    d. To update the dependencies right click on the **`espm` project > Maven > Update Project** and choose **OK** from the box that appears.
