## Prerequisites
 - You have your workflow modelled, built and deployed on Cloud Foundry environment using SAP Cloud Platform Workflow. If you do not have workflows configured, then refer to the following [blog](https://blogs.sap.com/2019/05/20/sap-cloud-platform-workflow-sample-application-in-cloud-foundry/).
 - You have created a portal site to create Monitor Workflow and My Inbox tiles. To learn on how to create a **Monitor workflows** and **My Inbox** tiles, refer to [Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/viewer/e157c391253b4ecd93647bf232d18a83/Cloud/en-US/97c079f9317c42bba31cc9ca9d4cc7c3.html).
 - You have **`WorkflowParticipant`**, **`WorkflowAdmin`** and **`WorkflowInitiator`** roles assigned to your user.
 - You have set up the SAP Cloud Platform Process Visibility in your Cloud Foundry tenant.
 - You have **`PVAdmin`**, **`PVDeveloper`** and **`PVOperator`** roles of SAP Cloud Platform Process Visibility assigned to your user. For more information on how to assign these roles, refer to [Assign the Process Visibility Roles to Users](cp-cf-processvisibility-setup-assignroles).

## Details
### You will learn
  - How to create a workflow instance in the SAP Cloud Platform Process Visibility Workspace

Process Visibility applications have pre-built integration with SAP Cloud Platform Workflow which makes it easier to discover available workflows and import the required events and context attributes.

Once you have modelled and activated the business scenario, go to your Monitor Workflows application and start a new instance of the workflow. Once the workflow has started, you will see the start and other events being received by the process visibility service. You can see these events using the Event Acquisition application and process them using the Monitor Scenario application.
