If you do not find the service in your list, proceed as follows:

  1. Click **Configure Entitlements**.

Now, select **Service Keys** on the navigation sidebar, and click **Create Service Key** to start the creation dialog.

 Click **Save** to create the service keys.

![Create Service Key](create-service-key-name.png)

You have successfully created service keys for your service instance. Make a local copy of the service keys. You will need the service keys values in [Set Up Postman Environment and Collection to call Data Attribute Recommendation APIs](cp-aibus-dar-setup-postman).

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](List your service instances)]

To list and access your service instances, there is no need to access the service via the Service Marketplace every time. In your **Space**, you can see a list of all your service instances.

**Go back** to your **dev** space using the breadcrumbs at the top of the page.

As you navigate through the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit and dig into more detail, the breadcrumbs at the top of the page show you the hierarchy of your navigation. You can use them to go back to previous steps.

![Breadcrumbs](nav-back-breadcrumbs.png)

Back in your space, click **Service Instances** on the navigation sidebar.

![Service Instances List](service-instances-list.png)

The list shows all your service instances across all services, including the service instance you have just created. You find here information on the service plan, referencing applications, created service keys and the current status of your instances. From here, you can manage your service instances, access or delete them, for example.
