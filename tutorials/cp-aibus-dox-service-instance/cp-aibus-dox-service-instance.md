[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](List your service instances)]

To list and access your service instances, there is no need to access the service via the Service Marketplace every time. In your space, you can see a list of all your service instances.

1. Go to your **dev** space using the breadcrumbs at the top of the page.

    As you navigate through SAP Cloud Platform trial and dig into more detail the breadcrumbs at the top of the page show you the hierarchy of your navigation. You can use them to go back to previous steps.

    ![Breadcrumbs](nav-back-breadcrumbs.png)

2. Back in your space, click **Service Instances** on the navigation side bar.

    ![Service Instances List](instance-list.png)

The list shows all your service instances across all services, including the service instance you have just created. Here, you find information on the service plan, referencing applications, created service keys and the current status of your instances. You can also manage your service instances, access or delete them, for example.
