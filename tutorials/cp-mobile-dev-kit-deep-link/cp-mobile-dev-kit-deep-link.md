## Details
### You will learn
  - How to open SAP standard apps like Mobile Cards, Fiori Client from MDK generic client
  - How to open an UI5 app running in a  Fiori Client from an MDK generic client
  - How to open a web page

---

Deep links are used to send users directly to an app instead of a website or a store saving users the time and energy locating a particular page themselves â€“ significantly improving the user experience.

If an app is already installed, you can specify a custom URL scheme (iOS Universal Links) or an intent URL (on Android devices) that opens that app. Using deep link, you can also navigate to specific events or pages, which could tie into campaigns that you may want to run.

>**This tutorial has been executed using public store MDK client which has out of the box functionality to open the SAP standard apps like SAP Mobile Cards and SAP Fiori Client.
If you are building a custom version of Mobile development kit client, there you can implement deep links by specifying related custom URL scheme.**

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Set up the application foundation)]

Make sure that you have completed required pre-Prerequisites mentioned in this tutorial.

This step includes creating the Mobile Development Kit project in the Editor.

Launch the SAP Web IDE and select the **MDK perspective** by clicking on the icon in the left panel.

Right click on Workspace folder and select **New** | **MDK Empty Project**.

![MDK](img_001.png)

>The _MDK Empty Project_ template creates a Logout action, Close page action, rule and an empty page (`Main.page`). After using this template, you can focus on creating your pages, other actions, and rules needed for your application.

>More details on _MDK template_ is available in [help documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/977416d43cd74bdc958289038749100e/Latest/en-US/cfd84e66bde44d8da09f250f1b8ecee6.html).

Enter the Project Name as `MDKDeepLink` and click **Next**.

![MDK](img_002.png)

Leave the default values in _Application Creation_ step as it is, click **Finish**.

After clicking Finish, the wizard will generate your MDK Application based on your selections. You should now see the `MDKDeepLink` project in the project explorer.

![MDK](img_003.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create a new rule)]

In the MDK editor, you will create 4 new JavaScript files:

* `OpenSAPMobileCards.js` to open SAP Mobile Cards app
* `OpenSAPFioriClient.js` to open SAP Fiori Client app
* `OpenUI5.js` to open an UI5 app running in SAP Fiori Client app
* `OpenSAPcom.js` to open `SAP.com` web page

>You can find more details about [writing a Rule](https://help.sap.com/viewer/977416d43cd74bdc958289038749100e/Latest/en-US/ef1e3404ff5f4ca68676acbda10e4bd0.html).

Right click on the **Rules** folder | **New** | **File**.

![MDK](img_004.png)

Enter the file name `OpenSAPMobileCards.js`, click **OK**.

Copy and paste the following code.

```JavaScript
export default function openurl(clientAPI) {
// Get the Nativescript UI Dialogs Module
const dialogs = clientAPI.nativescript.uiDialogsModule;
// Get the Nativescript Utils Module
const utilsModule = clientAPI.nativescript.utilsModule;
return dialogs.confirm("Do you want to leave the current app?").then((result) => {
    if (result === true) {
        //This will open SAP Mobile Cards app
   return utilsModule.openUrl("com.sap.content2go://").then(	                
            (success) => Promise.resolve(success),
            (failure) => Promise.reject('The requested app or page is not available ' + failure));
    } else {
        return Promise.reject('User Deferred');
    }
});
}
```
![MDK](img_005.png)

>`openUrl` is a `NativeScript` API to open an URL on device. You can find more details about [this API](https://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/utils#openurl-function).

Repeat the above step and create another new file:

Enter the file name `OpenSAPFioriClient.js`, click **OK**.

Copy and paste the following code.

```JavaScript
export default function openurl(clientAPI) {
// Get the Nativescript UI Dialogs Module
const dialogs = clientAPI.nativescript.uiDialogsModule;
// Get the Nativescript Utils Module
const utilsModule = clientAPI.nativescript.utilsModule;
return dialogs.confirm("Do you want to leave the current app?").then((result) => {
    if (result === true) {
        //This will open SAP Fiori Client App
    return utilsModule.openUrl("com.sap.fiori.client.xcallbackurl://x-callback-url").then(               
            (success) => Promise.resolve(success),
            (failure) => Promise.reject('The requested app or page is not available ' + failure));
    } else {
        return Promise.reject('User Deferred');
    }
});
}
```

![MDK](img_006.png)

Repeat the above step and create another new file:

Enter the file name `OpenUI5.js`, click **OK**.

Copy and paste the following code.

```JavaScript
export default function openurl(clientAPI) {
// Get the Nativescript UI Dialogs Module
const dialogs = clientAPI.nativescript.uiDialogsModule;
// Get the Nativescript Utils Module
const utilsModule = clientAPI.nativescript.utilsModule;
return dialogs.confirm("Do you want to leave the current app?").then((result) => {
    if (result === true) {
        //This will open Software Downloads app running in SAP Fiori Client
return utilsModule.openUrl("com.sap.fiori.client.xcallbackurl://x-callback-url/openFioriUrl?url=https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/softwarecenter").then(                  
            (success) => Promise.resolve(success),
            (failure) => Promise.reject('The requested app or page is not available ' + failure));
    } else {
        return Promise.reject('User Deferred');
    }
});
}
```

![MDK](img_007.png)

Create one more file and name it to `OpenSAPcom.js`.

Copy and paste the following code.

```JavaScript
export default function openurl(clientAPI) {
// Get the Nativescript UI Dialogs Module
const dialogs = clientAPI.nativescript.uiDialogsModule;
// Get the Nativescript Utils Module
const utilsModule = clientAPI.nativescript.utilsModule;
return dialogs.confirm("Do you want to leave the current app?").then((result) => {
    if (result === true) {
        //This will open SAP.com website
return utilsModule.openUrl("https://www.sap.com").then( 	                
            (success) => Promise.resolve(success),
            (failure) => Promise.reject('The requested app or page is not available ' + failure));
    } else {
        return Promise.reject('User Deferred');
    }
});
}
```

Save the changes.
