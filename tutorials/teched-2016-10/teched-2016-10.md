[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Go to your SAP HANA MDC instance in HCP)]

Log into [SAP HANA Cloud Platform](https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com) by opening the following URL in a new tab: https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com

Make sure you are using the **Europe (Trial)** landscape, and click on your account name to open the cockpit view.

In the left-hand navigation bar, navigate in **Persistence > Databases & Schemas** and check that you have database of the system type `HANA MDC (<trial>)` created.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Open SAP HANA Web-based Development Workbench)]

The database should be in the **STARTED** state.

Click on **SAP HANA Web-based Development Workbench**.

![Database Overview screen](hanapalabc02.jpg)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Open the Catalog tool)]

On the **SAP HANA Web-based Development Workbench** screen click on **Catalog**, which will allow you to create, edit, execute and manage SQL catalog artifacts in your **SAP HANA database**.

Logon using your developer user.

For brevity, you can also use the `SYSTEM` user, but ideally a separate user should be used.

![SAP HANA Web-based Development Workbench](hanapalabc03.jpg)

Then, from the **Catalog** perspective, click on **SQL** icon in the icon bar to open a new SQL Console.  

Type the following code and run it using the **Run** icon or press `F8` on the keyboard:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "SYS"."AFL_FUNCTIONS" WHERE AREA_NAME = 'AFLPAL'
ORDER BY FUNCTION_NAME;
```

If the **Predictive Analytics Library (PAL)** is properly installed in your **SAP HANA instance**, then the query will return the list of **PAL** predictive analytics algorithms available in the library.

You should be able to find `ABC` among **PAL** functions and this is the one you are going to use in this tutorial.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Introduction to PAL and ABC algorithm)]

The **Predictive Analysis Library (PAL)** defines functions that can be called from within `SQLScript` procedures to perform analytic algorithms.

**PAL** includes classic and universal predictive analysis algorithms in different data-mining categories, like Clustering, Classification, Regression, Association, Social Network Analysis etc.

**ABC Analysis** algorithm is used to classify objects (such as customers or products) based on a particular measure (such as revenue or profit).

It suggests that inventories of an organization are not of equal value, thus can be grouped into three categories (A, B, and C) by their estimated importance.

“A” items are very important for an organization. “B” items are of medium importance. “C” items are of the least importance.

An example of ABC classification is as follows:

- “A” items – 20% of the items (customers) accounts for 70% of the revenue.
- “B” items – 30% of the items (customers) accounts for 20% of the revenue.
- “C” items – 50% of the items (customers) accounts for 10% of the revenue.

In this tutorial you will classify customers into **ABC groups** accordingly to the revenue they generate based on some dummy data.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Create a schema and load input data)]

First create a new schema `TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC` and a table with some dummy data. As in the previous step just paste this code into SQL Editor and hit `Run`.

```sql
--SET SCHEMA FOR THE TUTORIAL
CREATE SCHEMA TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC;
SET SCHEMA TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC;

CREATE COLUMN TABLE DUMMYDATA (
  accountnr varchar(11) default NULL,
  location varchar(100) default NULL,
  total_amount double default NULL
);
```

You should see the `TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC` schema and the `DUMMYDATA` table created in the Catalog Explorer on the left:

![Catalog Explorer](hanapalabc05a.jpg)

Next load 100 records with randomly generated data from the  [`pal_abc_data.txt`](pal_abc_data.txt) file (**This is actually an SQL file to be downloaded**), where you find INSERT statements like below.

Copy all of them into SQL Editor and execute.

```sql
INSERT INTO DUMMYDATA (accountnr,location,total_amount) VALUES ('51670856799','Sao Tome and Principe',640);
INSERT INTO DUMMYDATA (accountnr,location,total_amount) VALUES ('19947726599','Ukraine',270);
-- and so on...
```

Commit inserts and verify all records have been loaded.

```sql
COMMIT;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.DUMMYDATA;
```

![Results of data load](hanapalabc05.jpg)

Now create a view that will be the input to the ABC algorithm.

```sql
CREATE VIEW TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.V_ABC_INPUT as (SELECT ACCOUNTNR as SOMEOBJECT, TOTAL_AMOUNT as SOMEAMOUNT from DUMMYDATA);
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.V_ABC_INPUT;
--Should return the 100 records
```

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Create the wrap procedure for ABC PAL function)]

To use PAL functions, you must do the following:

- Generate a procedure that wraps the PAL function with your specific data structures,
- Call the procedure, for example, from an `SQLScript` procedure.

>You can find more details in the **SAP HANA Predictive Analysis Library (PAL) Reference** document at http://help.sap.com/hana_platform.

Use the following code to generate the wrap procedure:

```sql
 /* Prepare Table Types */
 DROP TYPE PAL_ABC_DATA_VIEW_T;
 CREATE TYPE PAL_ABC_DATA_VIEW_T AS TABLE (SOMEOBJECT NVARCHAR(80), SOMEAMOUNT DOUBLE);  
 DROP TYPE PAL_CONTROL_T;
 CREATE TYPE PAL_CONTROL_T AS TABLE(Name VARCHAR(100), intArgs INT, doubleArgs DOUBLE, strArgs VARCHAR(100));  
 DROP TYPE PAL_ABC_RESULT_T;
 CREATE TYPE PAL_ABC_RESULT_T AS TABLE(ABC NVARCHAR(10), SOMEOBJECT NVARCHAR(80));

 /* Create the proc using the wrapper */
 /* Define and populate parameters table */
 DROP TABLE PAL_ABC_PDATA_TBL;
 CREATE COLUMN TABLE PAL_ABC_PDATA_TBL(
 POSITION INT,
 SCHEMA_NAME NVARCHAR(256),
 TYPE_NAME NVARCHAR(256),
 PARAMETER_TYPE VARCHAR(7)
 );
 INSERT INTO PAL_ABC_PDATA_TBL VALUES (1,'TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC','PAL_ABC_DATA_VIEW_T', 'in');  
 INSERT INTO PAL_ABC_PDATA_TBL VALUES (2,'TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC','PAL_CONTROL_T', 'in');  
 INSERT INTO PAL_ABC_PDATA_TBL VALUES (3,'TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC','PAL_ABC_RESULT_T','out');

 /* Call the wrapper procedure to generate our ABC calculation procedure */
 CALL SYS.AFLLANG_WRAPPER_PROCEDURE_DROP('TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC', 'PAL_ABC_CALCULATE');
 CALL SYS.AFLLANG_WRAPPER_PROCEDURE_CREATE ('AFLPAL', 'ABC', 'TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC', 'PAL_ABC_CALCULATE', TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.PAL_ABC_PDATA_TBL);
```

You should see following objects create in the `TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC` schema:

![Catalog Explorer](hanapalabc06.jpg)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Run the wrapper procedure and check the results)]

Now execute the procedure with the desired allocation of A, B, and C groups and desired number of parallel calculation threads.

In this example you will have `70%-20%-10%` distribution and 5 threads.

```sql
/* Prepare and execute the procedure with ABC Analysis */
/* Prepare parameters table */
DROP TABLE TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.PAL_CONTROL_TBL;
CREATE COLUMN TABLE TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.PAL_CONTROL_TBL
(Name NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
 intArgs INTEGER,
 doubleArgs DECIMAL(15, 2),
 strArgs NVARCHAR(100),
 PRIMARY KEY (Name));

TRUNCATE TABLE TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.PAL_CONTROL_TBL;
INSERT INTO TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.PAL_CONTROL_TBL
SELECT 'THREAD_NUMBER',5,null,null from DUMMY UNION ALL
SELECT 'PERCENT_A',null,0.70,null from DUMMY UNION ALL
SELECT 'PERCENT_B',null,0.20,null from DUMMY UNION ALL
SELECT 'PERCENT_C',null,0.10,null from DUMMY;

/* Execute the procedure */
DROP TABLE TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.PAL_ABC_RESULT_TBL;
CREATE COLUMN TABLE TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.PAL_ABC_RESULT_TBL
(ABC NVARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
 SOMEOBJECT NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
 PRIMARY KEY (ABC, SOMEOBJECT));
TRUNCATE TABLE TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.PAL_ABC_RESULT_TBL;

CALL TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.PAL_ABC_CALCULATE(TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.V_ABC_INPUT, TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.PAL_CONTROL_TBL, TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.PAL_ABC_RESULT_TBL) WITH OVERVIEW;
```

As a result the table `TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.PAL_ABC_RESULT_TBL` should be populated with the results of the ABC Analysis with account numbers assigned to particular A, B, or C group based on their revenue.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Check your results)]

Check the results. Firstly, check what group each account has been assigned to.

```sql
SELECT ABC AS ABC, T.SOMEOBJECT AS COMPANY, SOMEAMOUNT AS GROSS_AMOUNT
FROM TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.V_ABC_INPUT AS T INNER JOIN TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.PAL_ABC_RESULT_TBL AS R ON T.SOMEOBJECT = R.SOMEOBJECT
ORDER BY 1, 3 desc;
```

![ABC Groups assigned to accounts](hanapalabc07.jpg)

Secondly, using SAP HANA's SQL window functions, you can calculate percentages of the total revenue falling into particular groups and compare to the desired `70-20-10` distribution.

```sql
SELECT ABC AS ABC, count(*) AS NR_OF_ACCOUNTS, sum(SOMEAMOUNT) AS GROSS_AMOUNT, round(sum(SOMEAMOUNT) / (sum(sum(SOMEAMOUNT) ) over ()),2) AS PT_SHARE
FROM TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.V_ABC_INPUT AS T INNER JOIN TUTORIAL_PAL_ABC.PAL_ABC_RESULT_TBL AS R ON T.SOMEOBJECT = R.SOMEOBJECT
GROUP BY ABC
ORDER BY 1;  
```

![ABC Groups calculation verification](hanapalabc08.jpg)

In real-world distribution, you would expect that group A has a smaller count, but this is randomly generated data.

You have run your first PAL algorithm! Congratulations!
