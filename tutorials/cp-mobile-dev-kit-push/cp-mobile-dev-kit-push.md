You may clone an existing metadata project from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-mdk-tutorial-samples/tree/master/4-Level-Up-with-the-Mobile-Development-Kit/6-Enable-Push-Notifications-in-the-MDK-Public-Store-Client) and start directly with step 4 in this tutorial.

---

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Set up the application foundation)]

Make sure that you have already created a new destination `mobileservices_cf` as per [previous tutorial](fiori-ios-hcpms-setup). This is required to connect SAP Web IDE to Mobile Services on Cloud Foundry environment and have setup initial configuration in SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services as per [this tutorial](cp-mobile-dev-kit-ms-setup).

This step includes creating the Mobile Development Kit project in the Editor.

1.  Launch the SAP Web IDE and select the **MDK perspective** by clicking on the icon in the left panel.

    Right-click the workspace folder and select **New** | **MDK Empty Project**.

    ![MDK](img_002.png)

    >More details on _MDK template_ is available in [help documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/977416d43cd74bdc958289038749100e/Latest/en-US/cfd84e66bde44d8da09f250f1b8ecee6.html)

2.  Enter the **Project Name** as `mdk_push` and click **Next**.

    ![MDK](img_002.png)

3. Leave the default values in _Application Creation_ step as it is, click **Finish**.

4. After clicking Finish, the wizard will generate your MDK project `mdk_push` based on your selections.


[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create MDK actions to register for push notifications)]

In this step, you will create the following actions:

* **Push Notification Register action**: this will register the device with SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services for push notification.

* **Message actions**: these will display a message if Push Notification Register action has succeeded or failed.


1. Create a Push Notification Register action.

    Right-click the **Actions** folder | **New MDK Action** | choose **MDK Other Actions** in **Category** | click **Push Notification Register Action** | **Next**.

    ![MDK](img_003.png)

    Provide the below information:

    | Property | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Action Name`| `PushRegister` |

    ![MDK](img_004.png)

    >More details on _Push Notification Action_ is available in [help documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/977416d43cd74bdc958289038749100e/Latest/en-US/2c9594625f464a6aa91cd59dfbc6a04a.html).

    Click **Next** and then **Finish** on the confirmation step.

2. Define a success message if the Push Register Notification action is succeeded.

    Right-click the **Actions** folder | **New MDK Action** | choose **MDK Message Actions** in **Category** | click **Message Action** | **Next**.

    ![MDK](img_005.png)


    Provide the below information:

    | Property | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Action Name`| `PushRegisterSuccessMessage` |
    | `Type` | select `Message` |
    | `Message` | `Push Notification registered` |
    | `Title` | `Success` |
    | `OKCaption` | `OK` |
    | `OnOK` | `--None--` |
    | `CancelCaption` | leave it blank |
    | `OnCancel` | `--None--` |

    ![MDK](img_006.png)

    Click **Next** and then **Finish** on the confirmation step.


3. Define a failure message if the Push Register Notification action is failed.

    Right-click the **Actions** folder | **New MDK Action** | choose **MDK Message Actions** in **Category** | click **Message Action** | **Next**.

    ![MDK](img_005.png)

    Provide the below information:

    | Property | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Action Name`| `PushRegisterFailureMessage` |
    | `Type` | select `Message` |
    | `Message` | `Push Notification didn't register` |
    | `Title` | `Failure` |
    | `OKCaption` | `OK` |
    | `OnOK` | `--None--` |
    | `CancelCaption` | leave it blank |
    | `OnCancel` | `--None--` |

    ![MDK](img_007.png)

    Click **Next** and then **Finish** on the confirmation step.

4. Define _Success_ and _Failure_ actions for `PushRegister.action`.

    In the action editor for the new action, expand the **Common Action Properties** and provide the below information:

    | Property | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Success Action` | `PushRegisterSuccessMessage.action` |
    | `Failure Action` | `PushRegisterFailureMessage.action` |

    >When `PushRegister.action` gets executed successfully then `PushRegisterSuccessMessage.action` will be triggered or if `PushRegister.action` fails then `PushRegisterFailureMessage.action` will be triggered.

      ![MDK](img_008.png)

5. Save the changes to the `PushRegister.action`.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Call the push register action)]

In the step, you will set and call the Push Register Notification action when app is updated with the new metadata.

>It is up to developers how they want to call a Push Register Notification action.

1.  Double-click `Application.app` file, select the `PushRegister.action` for the `OnDidUpdate` event.

    ![MDK](img_009.png)

2. Save the changes to `Application.app` file.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Deploy and activate application)]

So far, you have learned how to build an MDK application in the SAP Web IDE editor. Now, we deploy this application definition to Mobile Services.

1.  Right-click the `mdk_push` MDK Application in the project explorer pane and select **MDK Deploy and Activate**.

    ![MDK](img_010.png)

2. Let the default configuration as it is and click **Next**.

    ![MDK](img_0111.png)

    >**Filter files**: will be filtered and ignored in web packing process.

    >**Externals**: are the list of NPM modules that are part of the MDK Client application and should not be validated in the bundle.


3.  Click the dropdown for Destination Name and select the `mobileservices_cf` destination, you will find list of existing application IDs, select the one you have chosen while creating the project.

    ![MDK](img_012.png)

    >By default, automatically deploy option is selected, In other words, the application is automatically deployed from Mobile Services to your MDK client.

4.  Click **Next** to finish the deployment from SAP Web IDE.

You should see **Application deployed successfully** message in console log.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Run the app in MDK client)]

>Make sure you are choosing the right device platform tab above. Once you have scanned and onboarded using the onboarding URL, it will be remembered. When you Log out and onboard again, same onboarding URL settings will be reused without the need to scan. You will need to use 3rd party QR scanner app in Android or device Camera in iOS, if you would like to scan a different onboarding URL.

[OPTION BEGIN [Android]]
