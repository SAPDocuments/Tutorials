## Prerequisites
 - [Use Machine Learning to Build a Movie Recommendation application using the XS advanced development model](https://developers.sap.com/group.hxe-aa-movielens.html)

## Details
### You will learn
- How to create CDS artifacts to expose your dataset as CDS entities.
- How to load your dataset content in the CDS entities.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1:](Which MovieLens dataset?)]

In order to build your movie recommendation engine, you will be using one of the `MovieLens` dataset.

These datasets are made available by the <a href="https://grouplens.org" target="new">```GroupLens``` Research &copy;</a> group.

They have collected and made available movie rating data sets from the <a href="http://movielens.org" target="new">```MovieLens```</a> web site which were collected over various periods of time.

The data set that you will be using for this series is the ***small*** version of the **`MovieLens` Latest Datasets** downloadable <a href="http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/" target="new">here</a>.

This dataset, thanks to its size, can quickly be uploaded in your SAP HANA, express edition instance.

Before using these data sets, please review the <a href="http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small-README.html" target="new">README</a> file for the usage licenses and other details.

> ### **Note:**:
>
> As the datasets get updated regularly, you will be provided with a copy of the ***small dataset***. so that the implemented validation will work.
>
> However, you are free to use the latest version of the dataset from the `MovieLens` website, but you won't be able to mark you work as completed as the validation will fail.
>
> In addition, if you have additional capacity resources, you may want to run this tutorial series with the larger datasets. but again the validations steps were built based on a local copy of the ***small dataset***.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1:](SAP HANA data import options)]

There are multiple ways to import data set files inside of your SAP HANA, express edition instance.

- ***Eclipse IDE***

The ***SAP HANA Tools*** plugin for Eclipse provides an ***Import/Export*** feature which would allow you to create the appropriate physical tables first and then import the data.

However, this would require the ***Eclipse IDE*** to be locally installed and properly configured with the ***SAP HANA Tools*** plugin.

Then, you would need to know the complete data file format description in order to create the tables with the proper columns structure. And, last but not least, any changes would require to recreate the all structure and reload the data.

If you want to learn more about this import method, you can check the following tutorial: [Import CSV into SAP HANA, express edition using the SAP HANA Tools for Eclipse](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/mlb-hxe-import-data-eclipse.html)

- ***SAP HANA HDB Client***

The **SAP HANA HDB Client** provides an ***IMPORT FROM*** statement allowing you to import CSV files physically located on your SAP HANA, express edition host using a SQL command.

However, this method requires that the table are created before the execution of the command.

If you want to learn more about this import method, you can check the following tutorial: [Import CSV into SAP HANA, express edition using IMPORT FROM SQL command](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/mlb-hxe-import-data-sql-import.html)

- ***SAP HANA Persistence Model***

The **SAP HANA extended application services, advanced model**, (XS advanced) provide a comprehensive platform for the development and execution of native data-intensive applications.

The application data model comprises all the database artifacts used to store and provision data for your application's back end and user interface.

As part of the process of defining the database persistence model for your application, you can create database design-time artifacts such as tables and views, for example using Core Data Services (CDS).

At the same time, you can also create procedures and functions using SQLScript, which can be used to insert data into (and remove data from) tables or views.

#### ***Solution***

As the purpose of this tutorial series is to discover how to use Machine Learning algorithms to build an end to end solution including a native SAP HANA application, you will be using the ***SAP HANA Persistence Model*** with the ***Core Data Service*** (CDS) artifacts in a ***SAP HANA Database Module***.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create a SAP HANA Database Module)]

Open the Web IDE, and login using the **`XSA_DEV`** credentials.

Switch to the ***Development*** perspective using the ![Web IDE Development](00-development.png) icon.

![Web IDE](01-01.png)

As a reminder the default URL for the Web IDE is:

 - `https://hxehost:53075`

A link to the Web IDE can also be found on the ***XSA Controller page*** at:

- `https://hxehost:39030`

In the left panel, right click on the **`movielens`** project folder, then select **New > SAP HANA Database Module**.

![Web IDE](01-02.png)

Set the name to **`db`** and click on **Next**.

![Web IDE](01-03.png)

Set the following details on the next screen:

| Name                        | Value               |
|:----------------------------|--------------------:|
| Name Space                  | `aa.movielens.db`   |
| Schema Name                 | `ml`                |
| SAP HANA Database Version   | `2.0 SPS 03`        |
| Build module after creation | `checked`           |

Click on **Finish**.

![Web IDE](01-04.png)

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create the folder structure)]

Expand the **`movielens/db/src`** folder.

Create the following directory structure:

```
|-- movielens/db/src
    |-- data
    |-- hdb
        |-- apl
            |-- afllang
            |-- procedures
            |-- views
        |-- pal
            |-- afllang
            |-- procedures
            |-- views        
        |-- summary
```

You can use the right click on the target folder and select **New > Folder**.

Enter the folder name, then click on **OK**.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Import the dataset CSV files)]

As the dataset files get updated periodically, and in order to ensure consistency of content and validation, a copy of the data is available under the <a href="https://github.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/tree/master/tutorials/hxe-aa-movielens-03/data" target="new">data</a> directory within the SAP Tutorial GitHub repository.

Download the following files locally (right click on the link, then use the ***Save link as*** option):

- <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hxe-aa-movielens-03/data/links.csv" target="new">links</a>
- <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hxe-aa-movielens-03/data/movies.csv" target="new">movies</a>
- <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hxe-aa-movielens-03/data/ratings.csv" target="new">ratings</a>
- <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hxe-aa-movielens-03/data/tags.csv" target="new">tags</a>

Again, before using these files, make sure you have reviewed the dataset <a href="http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small-README.html" target="new">README</a> file for the usage licenses and other details.

In the left side panel, expand the **`movielens/db/src/data`** tree node.

Right click on the **`data`** folder, and use the **Import** > **File or Project** menu item.

Select one of the previously downloaded files.

![Web IDE](02-03.png)

Click on **OK**.

Repeat the operation for all the previously downloaded files:

- <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hxe-aa-movielens-03/data/links.csv" target="new">links</a>
- <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hxe-aa-movielens-03/data/movies.csv" target="new">movies</a>
- <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hxe-aa-movielens-03/data/ratings.csv" target="new">ratings</a>
- <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials/master/tutorials/hxe-aa-movielens-03/data/tags.csv" target="new">tags</a>

Your package structure should now look like this:
