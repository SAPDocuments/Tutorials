## Prerequisites
 - [Create a Machine Learning Foundation service instance on the Cloud Foundry environment](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-mlf-create-instance.html)
 - [Install Postman as a REST client](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/api-tools-postman-install.html)
 - [Get your OAuth Access Token using a REST Client](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-mlf-rest-generate-oauth-token.html)

## Details
### You will learn
  - Call an API from a REST client like Postman
  - The basics about Machine Learning Foundation Service for Image Classification

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step](The Image Classification Service)]

The Image Classification service calculates and returns a list of classifications along with their probabilities for a given image. It extracts feature vectors for any given image for comparison, information retrieval, clustering, or further processing.

This is the list of accepted file extensions:

|Name                  | Description
|----------------------|--------------------
| **Archive file**     | `zip`, `tar`, `gz`, `tgz`
| **Image file**       | `jpg`, `jpe`, `jpeg`, `png`, `gif`, `bmp`

The images should be RGB, or 8-bit gray scale.

If an archive file is provided, no additional files can be provided.

The input file (or the archive file) is provided using form data (as an element named ***files*** in the form data).

The service will return a JSON response that includes the top classification with the associated scores.

For more details, you can check the [Inference Service for Image Classification on the SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/api/image_classification_api/resource).

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step](Call the API)]

Open a new tab in ***Postman***.

Make sure that the ***`my-l-foundation`*** environment is selected.

On the **Authorization** tab, select **Bearer Token**, then enter **`{{OAuthToken}}`** as value.

> ### **Note:**: the **`OAuthToken`** environment variable can be retrieved following the [Get your OAuth Access Token using a REST Client](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-mlf-rest-generate-oauth-token.html) tutorial.

Fill in the following additional information:

Field Name               | Value
:----------------------- | :--------------
<nobr>HTTP Method</nobr> | POST
<nobr>URL<nobr>          | <nobr>`https://mlftrial-image-classifier.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/api/v2/image/classification`</nobr>

> **Note** As a reminder, the URL depends on you Cloud Platform landscape region but for the trial landscape only ***Europe (Frankfurt)*** provide access to the Machine Learning Foundation services.

On the **Body** tab, keep **`form-data`** selected. Add a new key named **files** and switch it to **File** instead of **Text** (default).

Select your image file.

If you are missing some inspiration, you can use [Google Search](https://www.google.fr/search?q=duck&tbm=isch) to search for duck images.

Click on **Send**.

You should receive a response that includes a series of predictions entries for each input files:

![Postman](03.png)

```json
{
    "label": "drake",
    "score": 0.9270621538162231
}
```
