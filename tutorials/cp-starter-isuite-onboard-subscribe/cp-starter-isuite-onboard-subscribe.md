## Prerequisites
- You have created a **trial account on SAP Cloud Platform:** [Get a Free Trial Account on SAP Cloud Platform](hcp-create-trial-account)

## Details
### You will learn
-	How to start your SAP Cloud Platform Integration Suite trial
-	How to subscribe to the service and assign user roles
-	How to provision and activate the capabilities

SAP Cloud Platform Integration Suite combines the integration capabilities such as Process Integration, API Management, Integration Advisor, and Open Connectors into a cohesive and simplified toolkit for enterprise integrations. To provide a comprehensive integration experience, these services are not available separately, but only as part of the Integration Suite service plan.

The Integration Suite includes all integration capabilities in simple service plans. To know more on these plans, see [Integration Suite](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/#/serviceCatalog/f810c887-8d25-4942-9849-354837951066) service catalog.

This part of the series lets you experience the capabilities offered by SAP Cloud Platform Integration Suite. For the complete series, see [Request Product Details with an Integration Scenario](https://developers.sap.com/mission.cp-starter-integration-cpi.html).

> **IMPORTANT**: The Integration Suite trial account is intended for personal exploration and not for production use or team development. See: [Trial Scope](https://help.sap.com/viewer/51ab953548be4459bfe8539ecaeee98d/sap.cp.integration.suite/en-US/5cc6987511104c418b7cb4c25f3d9cb0.html).

>**WHERE TO START**: If you have already activated Cloud Integration (Process Integration) service in your existing trial account, we recommend you to do either of the following:

> **Option 1**: If you are unable to activate **`Integration Suite`** service, create a **`New Subaccount`** and then proceed to **Step 3**.

> **Option 2**: Unsubscribe to Process Integration service then proceed to **Step 3**.

> If you are new to SAP Cloud Platform or Cloud Integration, get started with **Step 1**.

> For a new subaccount, you need to assign entitlements by adding service plans and the quotas. For more information, see [Configure Entitlements and Quotas for Subaccounts](https://help.sap.com/viewer/ea72206b834e4ace9cd834feed6c0e09/Cloud/en-US/c90f3d522ee04e65bd87cdec8808e5ce.html).

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](The Use Case)]

Using this scenario, you design and execute an integration flow that reads product details from a public product catalog (`WebShop`) for a given product identifier. Product details include data such as the product name and price, for example. To accomplish the scenario, you use SAP Cloud Platform Integration Suite, and in particular, its capabilities *Cloud Integration* and *API Management*.

You use Cloud Integration to design and deploy an integration flow. When you have finished designing, you use the API Explorer tool of *API Management* to expose the integration flow endpoint as an API.

  - You also define how to access the API in terms of authentication by assigning a dedicated predefined policy template.
  - Using this policy template, you define API access based on the OAuth client credentials grant method.
  - Finally, you use API Management to call the API and get the product details in a response.
