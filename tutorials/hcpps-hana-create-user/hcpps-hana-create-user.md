## Prerequisites
  - **Proficiency:** Beginner
  - **Tutorials:** [Create a new HANA MDC instance](http://go.sap.com/developer/tutorials/hcpps-hana-create-mdc-instance.html)

## Next Steps
  - [Import a predictive demo dataset in your SAP HANA  instance](http://go.sap.com/developer/tutorials/hcpps-hana-dataset-import.html)

## Details
### You will learn
  - How to create a new user account on your HANA MDC instance using the ***SAP HANA Cockpit***
  - What are the roles and privileges required to use the SAP HCP predictive services

### Time to Complete
  **5 minutes**

### Why create new user account?
Each Trial HANA MDC instance comes with a ***HANA System Account***. This user account shall be used only to execute "System" related activities.
In the "real world", it is uncommon to use this user account to develop an "end-user" application.

1. From the ***SAP HANA Cockpit*** and connected with the ***HANA System Account***, click on **Manage Roles and Users**. This will open the ***SAP HANA Web-based Development Workbench***.

1. Complete the form following properties:

    Field Name | Value
    ---------- | --------------
    User Name  | `HCPPSTRIAL`
    Password   | `TemporaryPassword1`

    The values listed above are provided as example, you can choose other values for theses properties.

    We will use a temporary password here, as HANA will require this one to be changed on the first connection.

    HANA enforces a password policy which requires at least an upper case character and a digit.

1. In order to user the SAP HCP predictive, we will need to grant the following roles to the created user account:
    - `AFLPM_CREATOR_ERASER_EXECUTE`
    - `AFL__SYS_AFL_APL_AREA_EXECUTE`
    - `sap.hana.ide.roles::Developer`

    Select the **Granted Roles** tab, then click on the ![plus](0-plus.png) icon, then add the roles listed above.

    Click on the ![save](0-save.png) button in the top menu bar

1. This user account will also be used to import data and create a schema, we will need to grant the following system privileges to the created user account:
    - `CREATE SCHEMA`

    Select the **System Privileges** tab, then click on the ![plus](0-plus.png) icon, then add the privileges listed above.

    Click on the ![save](0-save.png) button in the top menu bar

1. And last but not least, in order to build our HTML5 application we will need to create a package.

    There are multiple options here. You can either use the `public` package or create a new package. We will use the `public` package during this tutorial.

    Select the **Package Privileges** tab, then click on the ![plus](0-plus.png) icon, then add the `public` package.

    Check **ALL** to assign all ***Package Privileges***.
