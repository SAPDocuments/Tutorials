## Details
### You will learn  
In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up trust between SAP Cloud Platform and SAP Jam Collaboration.

The purpose of the trust configuration is the support of principal propagation, forwarding the logged on identity in the cloud (SAP Cloud Platform) to the internal system (SAP Jam Collaboration), which means logging on with a user that matches this identity without the need of providing the password (SSO). By default, SAP Cloud Platform is configured to use the SAP ID Service as the default trusted IDP (identity provider).
