The SAP Data Hub App Launchpad serves as central entry point to all user interfaces of SAP Data Hub. You access it by opening (`https://sapdatahubtrial/`) via a web browser.

Enter **DEFAULT** as the **Tenant**, `DATAHUB` as **Username** and the password which you have selected during system setup as **Password** to logon to the Launchpad. The system displays the **Application Launchpad** page.
