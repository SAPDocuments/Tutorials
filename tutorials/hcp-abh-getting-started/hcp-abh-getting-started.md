[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]
[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step : ](Test the API in the Hub)]
Let's select an API to test and see some results. Select the **User Management** tile.

In order to test the API in the API Business Hub, you need to login. Click the **Log On** button at the top of the page to do so.

When you look at the API Documentation again for the `GET /User` endpoint, you will see a **Parameters** section with a bunch of fields. To test different query parameters, you need to click the **Try Out** button on the API endpoint.

This will enable to Parameter fields to make them editable. You can test different query parameters by providing a value in the input of the specified data type for that parameter.

The `GET /User` method will return a list of users from Success Factors. The top parameter tells the query to retrieve only the top _n_ results once all the other filtering is done. We don't want to see all a users data, only selected data points. In the `$select` parameter, using the _control_ key for Windows or _command_ key for MacOS, select `firstName`, `lastName`, and `jobTitle`. This will limit the data set returned to this 3 fields for the matching results and therefore reduce the size of the resulting data set. Also set an [OData Filtering Expression](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/odata-v4.0-part1-protocol.html#_Toc445374625) to show only users named `Sami`: **`firstName eq 'Sami'`**.

Once your parameters are all set, click the **Execute** button at the bottom of the documentation for that method.

If there aren't any issues, you will see the resulting request URL and the response body (in `JSON`) on your page.

Feel free to keep playing around in the SAP API Business Hub to better understand the methods available in the User Management API.
