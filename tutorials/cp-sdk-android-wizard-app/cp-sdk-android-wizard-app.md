[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create the project)]

1.  Open **Android Studio**.

    ![Android Studio](android-studio.png)

2.  Choose **Start a new SAP Cloud Platform Android project**, which is an option created by the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for Android Wizard.

    ![New project](new-project.png)

3.  The wizard can save the server connection details for multiple servers. Fill in the required fields as shown below.

    | Field | Value |
    |:----|:----|
    | Account Name | **`SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services Trial`** |
    | Admin API URL | **`See below for how to get this URL`** |
    | Admin UI URL | **`See below for how to get this URL`** |
    | Authentication Type | **`Basic`** |
    | Username | **`Username for your trial account`** |
    | Password | **`Password for your trial account`** |
    | Save Account Information | **`Check this so that you do not have to re-enter account information on subsequent runs of the wizard`** |

4.  Go to the SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services website and under **Important Links**, both Admin URLs are present and can be copied.

    ![Admin API and UI URL](admin-url.png)

    ![Server connection](server-connection.png)

5.  Click **Next** on the **Server Connection** tab.

6.  On the **Cloud Configuration** tab, select **Create** and provide the required information.

    | Field | Value |
    |:----|:----|
    | Application Name | **`Wiz App`** |
    | Application ID | **`com.sap.wizapp`** |
    | Authentication Type | **`Basic`** |

    ![Create tab information](create-application-wizard.png)

7.  Click **Next** to proceed to configuring the **OData Services**.

8.  Click **Add...** to add an OData service.

    ![OData services blank](odata-services-blank.png)

9.  SAP Cloud Platform mobile services provide a sample back-end destination named `com.sap.edm.sampleservice.v2` that is being used here to provide data for the application. It contains product categories, product, supplier, customer and sales order data. Since you are creating a new application, add `com.sap.edm.sampleservice.v2`.

    ![OData services add service](odata-services-add.png)

10.  Click **Next** to continue to the project configuration.

    ![OData services done](odata-services.png)

11.  On the **Android Studio Project** tab, provide the following configuration data.

    | Field | Value |
    |:----|:----|
    | Project Name | **`Wiz App`** |
    | Project Namespace | **`com.sap.wizapp`** |
    | Target Language | **`Java`** / **`Kotlin`** |

    >The screenshot below provides a Java example. Depending on which **Target Language** you choose, either Java or Kotlin code will be generated.

    ![Project configuration](project-configuration-java.png)

12.  On the **Project Features** tab, provide the following configuration data.

    | Field | Value |
    |:----|:----|
    | Use Discovery Service as Configuration Provider | **`uncheck`** |
    | OData | **`Online`** |
    | Create a sample user experience for the selected OData Destination | **`check`** |
    | Enable Logging | **`check`** |
    | Enable Upload | **`check`** |
    | Enable Usage Reporting | **`check`** |
    | Enable Push | **`optional`** |

    ![Project features](push-notification-checkbox-enabled.png)

13.  If you would like to add push notification support to your app, proceed to Step 2 which describes how to acquire the `google-services.json` file required for push messaging. Otherwise, uncheck **Enable Push**, click **Finish** and proceed to Step 3.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Enable push notifications)]

If you check the **Enable Push** checkbox, an error message is displayed explaining that you need to specify a `google-services.json` file. We will obtain this file from the [Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/) feature in [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

![Push Notifications enabled](push-notification-checkbox-enabled.png)

1.  Open the [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) console and click **Create project**.

    ![Add project in Firebase](firebase-add-project.png)

2.  Access **Project settings** for the newly created project.

    ![Project settings](firebase-project-settings.png)

3.  Add Firebase to your app.

    ![Add Firebase to your Android app](add-firebase-to-android.png)

    The **Android package name** must match the **Project Namespace** you used to create the app in Android Studio. In our example, the **Android package name** is **`com.sap.wizapp`**.

    ![Register App](firebase-register-app.png)

4.  Download the `google-services.json` file.

    ![Download google-services.json file](download-google-services-button.png)

5.  Now browse for the `google-services.json` file in the wizard. This file is placed into the app folder of the generated project and helps enable the app to work with Google Firebase notifications.

    ![Add google-services.json file to wizard](wizard-google-services-added.png)

    >You can add push configuration on the server as in the [Send Notifications to Your Android Application](cp-sdk-android-wizard-app-push) tutorial.

6.  Click **Finish** and proceed to Step 3.

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Explore the app)]

1.  Wait for the build to finish.

    ![Project created](project-created.png)

2.  Choose an emulator for running the app.
    >For more information on creating virtual devices that run in the Android Emulator, see [Create and manage virtual devices](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) in the Android Studio User Guide.

    ![Deployment target](choose-emulator.png)

3.  Click the **Run** toolbar icon.

    ![Run the project](run.png)

    The welcome screen is shown the first time the app is run.

    ![Welcome screen](welcome-screen.png)


4.  Log in with your username and password.

    ![Authentication screen](authentication-screen.png)


    The credentials you enter are securely stored by the app, and do not need to be re-entered the next time you open the app.

    The passcode (or fingerprint if enabled) screen provides an additional layer of security for your app.

    ![Passcode screen](create-passcode.png)

5.  You can modify the passcode policy in the Mobile Service Cockpit under **Client Policies**. The passcode screen will not be displayed if the **Enable Passcode Policy** is not checked.

    ![Passcode Policy](passcode-policy.png)

6.  Because **Enable Usage Reporting** is checked, this screen can be used to show details of how the collected data will be used. For now, select either **NOT NOW** or **OK**. **Usage Reporting** is covered in a later tutorial in this mission.

    ![Data Collection screen](data-collection-screen.png)

    The first screen of the app shows the different entities that are in the sample OData service.

    ![Entities screen](entities-screen.png)

7.  Tap **Products** to navigate to the Products list.

    ![Products screen](products-screen.png)


8.  Tap a list item to display the below editable detail screen.

    ![Category detail](product-detail.png)

>For further information on generating your app, see [Running the wizard](https://help.sap.com/doc/c2d571df73104f72b9f1b73e06c5609a/Latest/en-US/docs/user-guide/getting-started/creating_an_app.html).

Congratulations!  You have created your first Android app using the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for Android Wizard!
