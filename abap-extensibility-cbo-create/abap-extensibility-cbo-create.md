![Go to Fields and Logic](CBO_go2FieldsAndLogic_detail.png)

**Create** following fields

| :------------- | :--------------------------- | :-----------|
| ID             | Text of length 20, key field |             |   
| Validity Start Date | Date    | |
| Validity End Date | Date | |   
| Target Amount | Amount with Currency| |   
| Low Bonus Assignment Factor | Number of length 4, decimals 2 | Actual revenue must meet target more than that many times |
| High Bonus Assignment Factor | Number of length 4, decimals 2 | Actual revenue must meet target more than that many times |
| Low Bonus Percentage | Quantity with Unit | |   
| High Bonus Percentage | Quantity with Unit  | |

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Adding standard data to the structure)]
Back in the business Object's definition overview, **check** the System Administrative Data box to add standardized fields for `Created On`, `Created By`, `Last Changed On` and `Last Changed By`.

![Check System Administrative Data](CBO_checkSysAdminData.png)

By checking this box the four fields also appear as not editable in the field list.
These fields will be filled and updated automatically, so that you do not need to implement logic for this. Logic implementations for these fields even would be ignored.


[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Creating the database persistence)]
**Publish** the Business Object `Bonus Plan`.

![Press Publish](CBO_pressPublish.png)

This creates the database persistence of the Business Object.


[ACCORDION-END]
