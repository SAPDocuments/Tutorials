>**This tutorial has been executed with Mobile Services in SAP Cloud Platform Neo and Cloud Foundry environment, please switch to either tab according to your environment.**

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Define client log policy in Mobile Services cockpit )]

SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services provides administrators, developers and support staff with extensive logs and traces functionality to troubleshoot application issues. You can control the amount of information that is captured by setting the log level for individual logging components.

In this step, you will enable client log upload policy in **SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services Cockpit** for a given MDK app.

[OPTION BEGIN [Neo]]

Login to [Mobile Services Cockpit](fiori-ios-hcpms-setup), click `com.sap.mdk.demo` | **Client Policies**.

>Other policy parameters like Log Level, Delete Uploaded Log After, Maximum Number of Logs and Maximum Log Size currently have no effect.

>You can find more details about [Client Log Upload feature](https://help.sap.com/viewer/38dbd9fbb49240f3b4d954e92335e670/Cloud/en-US/36178b64b6bd4c9392cd421f6aa9ef12.html).

[OPTION END]

[OPTION BEGIN [Cloud Foundry]]

Login to [Mobile Services Cockpit](fiori-ios-hcpms-setup), click `com.sap.mdk.demo` | click **+** icon to add client log upload feature to the app.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create log actions)]

Logs help you trace events that occur while your application is running. You can create logging actions, set their priority levels and upload stored log entries.

You will create 3 actions:

* Log action of Type `SetState`: to turn the logger On, Off or Toggle

* Log action of Type `SetLevel`: to set log level (Debug, Info, Warn or Error)

* Log action of Type `Upload`: to upload logs from app to Mobile Services

>You can find more details about [MDK Log Actions](https://help.sap.com/viewer/977416d43cd74bdc958289038749100e/Latest/en-US/f906d3ed1919484c8f54050dfd0143ae.html).

![MDK](img_003.png)

First, create a log action of type `SetState`:

Right-click on the **Actions** folder | **New MDK Action** | **Log Action** | **Next**.

![MDK](img_004.png)

Provide the below information:

| Property | Value |
|----|----|
| `Action Name`| `LogSetState` |
| `Type` | `SetState` |
| `Log State`| On |

![MDK](img_005.png)

Click **Next** and then **Finish** on the confirmation step.

Next, create a log action of type `SetLevel`:

Right-click on the **Actions** folder | **New MDK Action** | **Log Action** | **Next**.

Provide the below information:

| Property | Value |
|----|----|
| `Action Name`| `LogSetLevel` |
| `Type` | `SetLevel` |
| `Log Level`| Debug |

>Setting log level to debug is not recommended for productive environment.

![MDK](img_006.png)

Click **Next** and then **Finish** on the confirmation step.

Next, create a log action of type `Upload`:

Right-click on the **Actions** folder | **New MDK Action** | **Log Action** | **Next**.

Provide the below information:

| Property | Value |
|----|----|
| `Action Name`| `LogUpload` |
| `Type` | `Upload` |

![MDK](img_007.png)

Click **Next** and then **Finish** on the confirmation step.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Bind Set Level log action to the success of Set State action)]

Double click on the `LogSetState.action` file | expand **Common Action Properties** and select `LogSetLevel.action` for **Success Action**.

![MDK](MDK_007.2.png)

Click **Save**.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Add Set State log action at app OnLaunch)]

You will add `LogSetState.action` at application `onLaunch` event so that app can start gathering logs on launch.

Double click on the `Application.app` file | click on **+** icon to add required action.

![MDK](img_008.png)

Double-click  `LogSetState.action` and click **OK**.

Click **Save**.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Define success/failure messages for Log Upload action)]

You will define two message actions for displaying success or failure when _Log upload action_ is triggered. Later, you will bind these actions in **Common Action Properties** of `LogUpload.action`.

First, you will create a success message action.

Right-click on the **Actions** folder | **New MDK Action** | **Message Action** | **Next**.

Provide the below information:

| Property | Value |
|----|----|
| `Action Name`| `LogUploadSuccessful` |
| `Type` | `ToastMessage` |
| `Message`| `Log File Uploaded` |
| `MaxNumberOfLines`| 1 |

Click **Next** and then **Finish** on the confirmation step.

Next, bind both actions in **Common Action Properties** of `LogUpload.action`.

Double click on the `LogUpload.action` and provide the below information:

| Property | Value |
|----|----|
| `Success Action`| `LogUploadSuccessful.action` |
| `Failure Action`| `LogUploadFailure.action`
| `Show Activity Indicator` | select it |

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Add Upload Log button to main page)]

You will add a toolbar item to the _main page_ called **Upload Logs**. You will link toolbar item to `LogUpload.action` you just created in step 2.

In `Main` page, drag and drop an **Toolbar Item** to the bottom right of the page.
