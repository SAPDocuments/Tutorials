## Details
### You will learn
-  How to change style of existing components
-  How to style own components


In this tutorial you will learn how to apply styling to the UI5 Web Components. You can add custom styles and even overwrite CSS Variables on any level. Also you'll learn how to style your custom components with the styling approach of SAP Fiori


---

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step: ](Changing the style for existing components)]
You can change the appearance of the Web Components by using [CSS Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css3_variables.asp). Per default, the Fiori 3 theme parameters are injected into the document head as CSS Variables. If you want to change e.g. the color of all texts, you can do that by creating another style element.

Open the `index.html` file inside of your `public` folder and add the following content inside of the `<head>` element:

```HTML
  <style>
    * {
      --sapUiTileTitleTextColor: limegreen;
    }
  </style>
```

The `sapUiTileTitleTextColor` CSS Variable changes the style of the `Card` titles and the `*` selector appends the style to all elements.

As a consequence, all HTML Elements in the subtree where this style was applied are now displaying their texts in `limegreen` instead of `#6a6d70` which would be the default value for Fiori 3. You can change CSS Variables on any level - in the head, or on every single element by using either CSS classes or element style.

A full list of all supported CSS Variables can be found [here](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents-react/blob/master/packages/base/src/styling/sap_fiori_3.ts) or in the [SAPUI5 Theming Parameters Toolbox](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/m/demokit/theming/webapp/index.html).

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step: ](Style your own component)]

If you want to add a custom component to your app, but still want to use the styling approach of the UI5 Web Components. You can hook into the theming by using [react-jss](https://cssinjs.org/react-jss/?v=v10.0.0)

1. Install `react-jss`

    ```sh
    npm install react-jss
    ```

2. Create a custom component `MyCustomElement.jsx` under `./src` with following content:

    ```JSX
    import React from "react";
    import { createUseStyles } from "react-jss";

    const styles = ({ parameters }) => ({
      container: {
        backgroundColor: parameters.sapUiGlobalBackgroundColor,
        fontFamily: parameters.sapUiFontFamily,
        height: "50px",
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center"
      },
      text: {
        color: parameters.sapUiNegativeText,
        fontSize: parameters.sapUiFontHeader1Size
      }
    });

    const useStyles = createUseStyles(styles);

    export const MyCustomElement = () => {
      const classes = useStyles();

      return (
        <div className={classes.container}>
          <span className={classes.text}>My custom Text Element</span>
        </div>
      );
    };
    ```
    When using the jss styling functions, the function will be called with an object with three properties:

    ```JSX
    {
     theme: 'the current theme as string, e.g. "sap_fiori_3"',
     parameters: "object with all styling parameters, please check the CSS Variables link.",
     contentDensity: 'Current Content Density mode, either "Compact" or "Cozy".'
    }
    ```

3. Import the custom component and add it to your `Home` component.

    ```JSX
    import { MyCustomElement } from "./MyCustomElement";
    ```

    ```JSX
     return (
        <FlexBox
          justifyContent={FlexBoxJustifyContent.Center}
          wrap={FlexBoxWrap.Wrap}
        >
          <MyCustomElement />
       ...
    ```
    ![Custom Element](01_customElement.png)

   Now you can see, that the element has the same `fontFamily` and uses the same semantic colors as the UI5 Web Components for React.
