[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Add SAP HANA Client to Project)]

The SAP HANA `hdb` npm module needs to be added to our package to support SAP HANA.

```bash
npm install hdb --save
```

The CAP application will still use SQLite in-memory database for local testing, while the SAP HANA database should be used "productively" in the cloud.

[VALIDATE_1]

[ACCORDION-END]
[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Switch to hdbtable Deployment)]

By default, the deployment uses the `hdbcds` as deployment format. However, this isn't supported for SAP HANA Cloud and the configuration needs to be changed to use the `hdbtable` and `hdbview` format.

1. Add the following snippet at the end of your `package.json` in your `cpapp` project:

    <!-- cpes-file package.json:$.cds -->
    ```json [4-13]
    {
      "name": "cpapp",
      ...
      "cds": {
        "requires": {
          "db": {
            "kind": "sql"
          }
        },
        "hana": {
          "deploy-format": "hdbtable"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    * [Using Databases](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/databases#get-hana)
    * [CAP Configuration](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-env)

2. Run `cds watch` and check that your app still works locally as it used to work before at <http://localhost:4004/>.


**There are different options to continue:**

You already have an SAP HANA Cloud service instance in your Cloud Foundry space **&rarr;** You're set. Nothing to do.

**Option 1:** You want to use an SAP HANA Cloud service instance from a different Cloud Foundry org or space, but in the same landscape **&rarr;** continue with [Use an existing SAP HANA Cloud Service Instance](#option-2-use-an-existing-sap-hana-cloud-service-instance).

**Option 2:** You want to create a new SAP HANA Cloud service instance **&rarr;** continue with [Create an SAP HANA Cloud Service Instance](#option-3-create-an-sap-hana-cloud-service-instance).
