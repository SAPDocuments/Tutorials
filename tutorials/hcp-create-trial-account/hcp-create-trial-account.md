 ![Log on again](logon-again.png)

Here, you can now create a subaccount which lives in a geographic region. Choose one of regions from this list.    

> We suggest the *Europe (Frankfurt)* region because it has the largest list of services.  If you want to use a region closer to you, [check to be certain it has the services you want before selecting it](https://help.sap.com/doc/aa1ccd10da6c4337aa737df2ead1855b/Cloud/en-US/3b642f68227b4b1398d2ce1a5351389a.html?3b642f68227b4b1398d2ce1a5351389a.html).

![Choose a nearby region](select-region.png)

You will then see a dialog box while the account is set up.  When complete, the dialog box will look like this.  Click **Continue** to close to popup.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step](Navigate to the Cloud Foundry space)]

You will see two buttons on the welcome screen of the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit. Click on **Enter Your Trial Account** to see your global account.

![enter trial account](enter-trial.png)
> Bookmark the link for fast and quick access to the cockpit.  

The global trial account contains **one** subaccount and space. Navigate to subaccount by clicking on the tile named **trial** (this name may vary if you created the subaccount manually).

![enter subaccount](global-account.png)


To get to the space, in which your applications and services live, click on the **dev** space.

![enter space](sub-account.png)



[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]
[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step](Learn about Applications and Service Marketplace tabs)]

A Cloud Foundry space is the logical container of your runtime artefacts such as **Applications**, and **Service Instances**.

The **Applications** tab is where all of your applications will be listed, and new applications can be added in to your Cloud Foundry runtime environment.  

![The Applications Tab](space-apps.png)

The **Service Marketplace** is where you can find services to attach to any of your applications.  These services are provided by SAP Cloud Platform to make it easier to create, and produce, web applications quickly and easily. Once a service has been created, we call it a service instance.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]
[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step](Understand the trial counter)]

You can find a small counter on the top of the screen. This counter indicates how many days you have left in your free trial. Once the counter goes to zero, all your apps may be stopped and your subaccount will go to sleep. This means all apps will be stopped and you won't be able to log in via the CF CLI anymore (until you extend your trial).

Extending the trial means you will get another 30 days until the account will go to sleep. After extending two times (e.g., 90 days) your subaccount will be deleted (i.e., all apps and services will be gone and you cannot log in via the CLI anymore).

After this point, you can start your new trial from scratch via the SAP Cloud Platform cockpit (see step 6).
