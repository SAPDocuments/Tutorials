## Details
### You will learn
  - How to enable and configure workflow, business rules and process visibility services

Intelligent Business Process Management is a family of services to automate business processes, manage decision logic and provide end-to-end visibility in your processes.

Users can now use SAP Cloud Platform Workflow, SAP Cloud Platform Business Rules and SAP Cloud Platform Process Visibility services together to create process extensions on top of any business application, orchestrate tasks or build process-centric differentiating applications.

In this tutorial mission, setup and use these services to automate and achieve operational insights into employee onboarding process.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Check Entitlements)]

To create service instances for business process management services, you need to ensure that you have the right set of entitlements in your trial account.

1. In your web browser, open the [SAP Cloud Platform trial cockpit](https://cockpit.hanatrial.ondemand.com/).

2. Navigate to the trial global account by clicking **Enter Your Trial Account**.

    !![Trial global account](01_Foundation20Onboarding_Home.png)

    >If this is your first time accessing your trial account, you'll have to configure your account by choosing a region (select the region closest to you). Your user profile will be set up for you automatically.  

    >Wait till your account is set up and ready to go. Your global account, your subaccount, your organization, and your space are launched. This may take a couple of minutes.

    >Choose **Continue**.

    >![Account setup](02_Foundation20Onboarding_Processing.png)

3. From your global account page, choose the `trial` tile to access your subaccount.

    !![Enter Trial Subaccount](entertrialaccount.png)

4. Click **Entitlements** from left panel to check if you have all the below listed entitlements in your subaccount. These entitlements are needed to run other tutorials of this mission.

    |  Entitlement     | Description
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Business Rules, Workflow and Process Visibility | These are core services of Intelligent BPM which will be needed to run the next tutorials.
    |  Portal, Application Runtime, HTML5 Applications | These services are needed to setup and access Process Visibility and Workflow applications from Fiori Launchpad
    |  Connectivity    | This service is needed to create and configure destinations

    > If you do not see these entitlements in your subaccount then follow this [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-trial-entitlements.html) that describes how to configure entitlements in your account.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Create destination for API Business Hub)]

The sample business rule used in this scenario is published in API Business Hub. This destination will be used in SAP Cloud Platform Business Rules to connect to API Business Hub to discover and import sample rules.

1. Go back to the subaccount **trial** and switch to **Connectivity | Destinations** from the left-hand navigation.

2. Click **New Destination**.

3. Enter the following details under **Destination Configuration**:

    |  Field Name     | Value
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Name           | `BUSINESSRULES_APIHUB`
    |  URL            | `https://api.sap.com`
    |  Authentication | `BasicAuthentication`
    |  User           | your trial user id
    |  Password       | your trial password

    ![Create Destination](createdestination-apihub.png)

4. **Save** the destination.


[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Create destination for Business Rules APIs)]

The sample workflow calls business rules to determine the list of equipment needed for the new hire. This destination (`BUSINESS_RULES`) will be used while modelling the workflow to call the business rules APIs.

Choose **New Destination**, and enter the following data:

|  Field Name        | Value
|  :---------------- | :-------------
|  Name              | `BUSINESS_RULES`
|  URL               | `https://bpmruleruntime.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/rules-service`
|  Authentication    | `OAuth2ClientCredentials`
|  Client ID         | `<use your client ID from the Business Rules service instance>`
|  Client Secret     | `<use your secret from the Business Rules service instance>`
|  Token Service URL | `https://<userid>.authentication.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token` where `userid` is your trial account user id

>Replace `eu10` with `us10` in the URLs if your trial account is in US region. For example, the URL in above destination will become:

> `https://bpmruleruntime.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/rules-service`

>To get Client ID, Client Secret and Token Service URL, (a) navigate into your **dev** space in your trial account, (b) select **Service Instances** from left panel, (c) search for **rules**, and then select **`businessrules`** service instance and (d) navigate into **`businessrules`** to get `clientid`, `clientsecret`, and `url`.
![Get Security Token](getsecurity.png)

![Configure Destination](createdestination-rules.png)


[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 10: ](Access applications)]

These applications will be used in the next tutorials to work with business rules, workflow and process visibility. One of these links is for the Fiori Launchpad which will be used to access workflow and process visibility applications and another link is to access business rules editor.

You can open both the links in different browser tabs and use them in further tutorials.

1. Click **Spaces** and then navigate into **dev** space.

2. In **dev** space, click **Applications** and from among the available applications select `BPMServicesFLP_appRouter` application.

    ![Open Application](openapprouter.png)

3. In the **Overview** section, click app-router link to open workflow, business rules and process visibility applications.

    > Log on with your trial user ID and password.

    ![Open FLP](approuterlink.png)

    The app-router link will open the SAP Fiori launchpad with **Workflow** and **Process Visibility** tiles.

    ![Open BPM FLP](bpmFLP.png)

    In the same app-router link, copy and paste this URL fragment `/comsapbpmrule.ruleeditor/index.html` in the end to open business rules editor.

    > For example: `https://trial-userid-dev-bpmservicesflp-approuter.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/comsapbpmrule.ruleeditor/index.html`

    ![Open Rule Editor](openruleeditor.png)

These steps complete the setup of the starter scenario for Intelligent Business Process Management in your trial account. In the next tutorial, you will access the sample content of these different services, quickly set them up in your account and then run the scenario to get an integrated experience.
