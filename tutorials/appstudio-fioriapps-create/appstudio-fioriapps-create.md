## Prerequisites
  - You have created an SAP Fiori dev space in SAP Business Application Studio. See [Create a preconfigured dev space for developing SAP Fiori apps](appstudio-devspace-fiori-create).
  - The SAP Fiori dev space is in status `RUNNING` and you opened it.
  - You configured a destination to SAP Gateway Demo System (ES5) (see [Connect SAP BTP to Your SAP Gateway Demo System Account (ES5)](cp-portal-cloud-foundry-gateway-connection)).


## Details
### You will learn
  - How to create an SAPUI5 application for SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP), Cloud Foundry environment
  - How to test-run the app locally in the dev space

You will build an application that presents a list of suppliers from an on-premise backend. The suppliers' data will be retrieved from the `BusinessPartnerSet` collection in the `GWSAMPLE_BASIC` OData service that is available from SAP's ES5 demo gateway.

After a period of idle time the dev space is automatically stopped. In order to re-start the dev space open the [dev space manager](https://triallink.eu10.trial.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/), click the **Play** icon, and click the dev space.

The period for idle time for Enterprise accounts is different than for trial accounts.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create new SAP Fiori project)]

1. In the **Welcome Page** click **Start from template**.

    !![Open Dev Space](AppStudio-Welcome-Tab-withOUT-Extensions-Loaded-Notification-.png)

    >If the Welcome Page does not appear, in the menu bar, select **View | Find Command** to open the **command palette** and select the command **Welcome**. The command palette is opened at the top-center of the SAP Business Application Studio window.

    >!![Welcome Page from command palette](AppStudio-Welcome-Page-from-Command-Palette-.png)

    >The easiest way to develop an SAP Fiori freestyle app from scratch is to create it from a template. To continue developing an existing application, the best practice is to use git source code management and clone the repository.

    >Using the UI wizard you can at any point click the `Back` button to go back to the previous step, or click the specific wizard step to go back to that step.

    > You can also create a project from the terminal using Yeoman.

2. For convenience, click the **Explorer** view button to close the `Explorer` view.

3. Make sure that the target folder is `/home/user/projects`, select the **SAP Fiori Freestyle Project** template, and click **Start**.

    !![Fiori project template](AppStudio-Fiori-Project-Template-.png)

4. For **Target Running Environment**, select the following, and click **Next**.

    | Step | Parameter | Value |
    |:-----|:----------|:------|
    | A | Select the target running environment | **Cloud Foundry** |
    | B | Select the template you want to use | **SAPUI5 Application** |

    !![fiori project template](AppStudio-Fiori-Project-Template-Target-Running-Environment-.png)

5. For **Project Name**, enter `FioriDemo`, and click **Next**.

    !![Fiori project template - project name](AppStudio-Fiori-Project-Template-Project-Name-.png)

6. For **Approuter Configuration**, select **Managed Approuter** and provide a unique service name, e.g. **BP**, and click **Next**.

    !![central approuter](Managed-Approuter-image.png)

    >When end-users access an app in the Cloud Foundry environment, they actually access the Application Router first. The application router is used to serve static content, authenticate users, rewrite URLs, and forward or proxy requests to other micro services while propagating user information.

    >The recommendation is to use the **Managed Approuter** that provides many benefits, when compared to the Standalone Application Router, such as save resources, lower maintenance efforts, etc. Standalone Application Router should only be used in advanced cases, for example when application router extensibility is required. More information is available in [Developing HTML5 Applications in the Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/11d77aa154f64c2e83cc9652a78bb985.html)
