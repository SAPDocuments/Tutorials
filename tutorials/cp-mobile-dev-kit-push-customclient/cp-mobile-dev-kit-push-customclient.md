[OPTION END]

[OPTION BEGIN [iOS]]

In order to implement Push Notifications, a paid Apple developer account is required. Students or other developers with a personal Apple ID for their team will not be able to use push notifications, because they will not have access to the Developer Portal to generate the required certificate.

To enable your app for push notifications, you need to carry out the following tasks:

* Obtain a certificate signing request
* Register an iOS App ID
* Create a new development certificate .CER file
* Install the .CER file and create the .p12 file
* Register your device

1. Obtain a certificate signing request

    In order to use the **Apple Push Notification service**, you need to create a **CSR file**.

    On your Mac, open the **Keychain Access** application, and navigate to **Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority...**

    ![MDK](img_029.png)

    In the dialog, enter the email address which is associated with your Apple Developer account. Also, make sure you check the **Request is saved to disk** option.

    ![MDK](img_030.png)

    Click **Continue**.

    Choose a folder to store the certificate -- it is good practice to store generated files in a separate folder for each project -- and click **Save**.

    Once you see a dialog saying the certificate is saved successfully, click **Done** to finish.

    ![MDK](img_031.png)

2. Register an iOS App ID

    Go to your [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com) and click **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles**.

    ![MDK](img_040.40.png)

    Click **+** icon to register a unique **Identifiers** for your application.

    ![MDK](img_040.png)

    Select **App IDs** and click **Continue**.

    ![MDK](img_041.png)

    Provide a unique **Bundle ID** name and **Description**.

    ![MDK](img_042.png)

    Scroll down and select the **Push Notifications** capability from the list, click **Continue**.

    ![MDK](img_043.png)

    In the following screen, select option for **Deployment Details** and then click **Continue**.

    Confirm your App ID by clicking on **Register**.

3. Create a new development certificate .CER file

    Under **Identifiers**, search for the App ID that you registered in previous step.

    ![MDK](img_060.png)

    Scroll down and select the **Push Notifications** capability, click **Configure**.

    ![MDK](img_061.png)

    To configure push notifications for the App ID `com.sap.mdk.demo`, a Client SSL Certificate is required that will allow the notification server to connect to the Apple Push Notification Service. Each App ID requires its own Client SSL Certificate.

    Click **Create Certificate** to start the process for creating the needed `.CER` file.

    ![MDK](img_062.png)

    Click **Choose File** and browse to the downloaded Signing Request `CSR` file, click **Continue**.

    Apple will now create a `.CER` file for you which is issued by the **Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority**.

    ![MDK](img_035.png)

    Click **Download** to download your certificate.

    ![MDK](img_036.png)

4. Install the .CER file and create the .p12 file

    In order to configure the `APNS` on **SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services**, you need to install the `.CER` file and create the needed `.p12` file.

    >A `.p12` file is a encrypted container for the certificate and private key. This file is needed by Mobile Services for the `APNS` configuration.

    Locate your downloaded `.CER` file and double-click it in order to install the certificate.

    >In case the **Add Certificate** dialog pops up make sure to choose **Login** from the dropdown and click **Add**.

    If the certificate is added correctly to the Keychain you should see it in the `MyCertificates` section, make sure you selected **login** as keychain.

    ![MDK](img_037.png)

    Select the certificate as well as the private key and right-click to export those two items.

    ![MDK](img_038.png)

    Make sure that in the dropdown **Personal Information Exchange (.p12)** is selected and click **Save**. You will be prompted to enter a password, click **OK** to export the files.

    ![MDK](img_039.png)

5. Register your device

    Click **+** icon to register your iOS device.

    ![MDK](img_044.png)

    Provide **Device Name** & **Device ID (UDID)** and then click **Continue**.

    ![MDK](img_045.png)
