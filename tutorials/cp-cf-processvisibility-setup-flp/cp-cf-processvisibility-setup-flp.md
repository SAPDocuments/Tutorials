### Prerequisites
  - You must have a trial account on SAP Cloud Platform.
  - You have created a service instance of Process Visibility and have noted the Process Visibility service instance name. For more information, see [Create a Service Instance of SAP Cloud Platform Process Visibility](cp-cf-processvisibility-setup-serviceinstance).

### Details
### You will learn
- How to configure your multi-target application to view Process Visibility tiles in SAP Fiori launchpad

The UIs of Process Visibility must be configured on SAP Web IDE. After the configuration, the default tiles of Process Visibility will be available on SAP Fiori launchpad. For more information, see [Consuming UI Applications on SAP Fiori Launchpad](https://help.sap.com/viewer/62fd39fa3eae4046b23dba285e84bfd4/Cloud/en-US/27850a2be7834ccfa209a2a3aabd216e.html).

1. Right-click the `mta.yaml` file and choose **Open Code Editor**.


    ![import file](FLP-step3-MTA1.png)

2. Add the name of your service instance in the `requires` section of the `approuter` module and the SAP Fiori launchpad site module. In this example, we have created a service instance called `pvservice`. Ensure that you provide the name of the service instance that you have created during [Create a Service Instance of SAP Cloud Platform Process Visibility](cp-cf-processvisibility-setup-serviceinstance).

    ![import file](FLP-step3-MTA2.png)

3. Add the name of your service instance in the `resources` section of the SAP Fiori launchpad site module. In this example, we have created a service instance called `pvservice`. Ensure that you provide the name of the service instance that you have created during [Create a Service Instance of SAP Cloud Platform Process Visibility](cp-cf-processvisibility-setup-serviceinstance).

    In the **Deploy to SAP Cloud Platform** dialog, choose **Deploy**.

    ![log on](MTA-12.png)

4. Open the job console at the end of the deployment process, and search for the App Router URL. It should appear in the console as follows:

    `Application <app name>-approuter has been created. Application URL is: https://<application URL>.`

    >To know more about accessing the applications using SAP Cloud Platform cockpit, refer to [Access Launchpad Runtime](https://help.sap.com/viewer/ad4b9f0b14b0458cad9bd27bf435637d/Cloud/en-US/4657960c8fab408eb84a575d267e1041.html).

5. Copy the URL to your browser to access the tiles on SAP Fiori launchpad. You can now see default tiles of Process Visibility on SAP Fiori launchpad.
