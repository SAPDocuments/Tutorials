In this group of tutorials our goal is to create an attractive Portal site using the SAP Cloud Platform Portal service. But before we can do this, there are some steps you need to do in the SAP Cloud Platform cockpit.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Subscribe to the Portal service)]

Before you can access the Portal service, you first need to subscribe to it.

1. [Log onto SAP Cloud Platform](https://cockpit.hanatrial.ondemand.com) and click **Enter Your Trial Account**.

    >If this is your first time accessing your trial account, you'll have to configure your account by choosing a region (select the region closest to you). Your user profile will be set up for you automatically.

    >Wait till your account is set up and ready to go. Your global account, your subaccount, your organization, and your space are launched. This may take a couple of minutes.  

2. Click **Continue**.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Add yourself to the Super_Admin role)]

To be able to do administrative tasks in the Portal you must be assigned to the `Super_Admin` role. In this step, you will first create a role collection and then you'll assign yourself to the `Super_Admin` role.

1. Click on your subaccount again using the breadcrumbs at the top.

    |  Role Template           | **`Super_Admin`**
    |  Role    | **`Super_Admin`**
