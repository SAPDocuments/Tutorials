## Details
### You will learn
  - How to configure an application in Mobile Services
  - How to write a MDK rule to parse the response from REST API
  - How to retrieve and modify the data with calls to `Petstore` API

To be updated:  You may clone an existing project from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-mdk-tutorial-samples/tree/master/4-Level-Up-with-the-Mobile-Development-Kit/7-Consume-rest-api-in-mdk-app) and start directly with step 8 or 13 in this tutorial but make sure you complete step 2.


---

Mobile Development Kit allows you to consume REST APIs. You need to first define REST endpoint as a destination in Mobile Services and then need to write MDK rules (JavaScript) to consume it.Â A rule will be needed to parse the response and then decide what to do.

A publicly available `Petstore` API from [swagger.io](https://petstore.swagger.io) is used as an example in this tutorial.

!![MDK](img_8.png)

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Understand the Petstore API to retrieve data )]

1. Open [`Swagger Petstore`](https://petstore.swagger.io/), find all pets with status as `available`.

    !![MDK](img_1.png)

2. Click **Execute** to get the response.

    !![MDK](img_2.png)

    By looking at results, you now have understood

    -	what is the Request URL to retrieve pet information
    -	what is header parameter to be passed in GET call
    -	what is the response code
    -	how the response body looks like

With above details, you will next configure an app in Mobile Services, add root of request URL as a destination and then consume it in MDK.
