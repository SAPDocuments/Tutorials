## Details
### You will learn
In this tutorial, you will learn where to find and test the **SAP Leonardo Machine Learning Functional Services** published on the SAP API Business Hub that consumes images content.

This service allows you to calculates and returns a list of classifications/labels along with their probabilities for a given image.

The **Image Classification** Machine Learning Functional Services will be used as an example to demonstrate how to consume image content, but you will be able to transpose this tutorial to other services which also consume images content like :

 - **[Product Image Classification API](https://api.sap.com/api/product_image_classification_api/resource)**
 - **[Multi-Instance Image Segmentation](https://api.sap.com/api/instance_segmentor_api/resource)**
 - **[Scene Text Recognition](https://api.sap.com/api/scene_text_recognition_api/resource)**
 - **[Face Detection](https://api.sap.com/api/face_detection_api/resource)**
 - **[Customizable Object Detection](https://api.sap.com/api/object_detection_api/resource)**
 - **[Human Detection](https://api.sap.com/api/human_detection_api/resource)**

### Time to Complete
**10 Min**

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Search the SAP API Business Hub)]

In order to consume the **Image Classifier Service** SAP Leonardo Machine Learning Foundation service, you will first need to get the service URI, request and response parameters.

Go to [https://api.sap.com/](https://api.sap.com).

![SAP API Business Hub](01.png)

Then you will be able to search for the **SAP Leonardo Machine Learning - Functional Services**, then click on the package found.

Select **Inference Service for Customizable Image Classification**.

You can also access the page directly from the following address:

 - <https://api.sap.com/api/image_classification_api/resource>

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Analyze the service)]

As you can notice the API has only one resource (or service): `/classification`.

Now click on the **`/classification`** link to expand the section.

> **Note**: the term *inference* refers to the application phase (scoring) an existing model (as opposed to the training or inception phase) and *sync* for synchronous.

As stated in the description, the service accepts either:

 - an archive file with a zip/tar extensions containing multiple image files
 - a single image
 - a list of image as input

The service returns a classification list with its scores (confidence).

The supported image formats are ***JPEG***, ***PNG***, ***TIF*** or ***BMP*** (the actual content format is validated, so renaming files may simply not work).

The input file, files or archive file will be sent as a `FormData` query parameter in the service request.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Test the service)]

In the top right corner of the page, click on the **Log On** button.

You will be prompted for your SAP credentials (you can use your SAP Cloud Platform credentials for example).

Scroll down to the **Parameters** section and click on the **Try out** button, then you can use the **Choose File** button next to `files` parameter to select your files.

Select any image file on your local machine (and if you are missing some inspiration, use [Google Search](https://www.google.fr/search?q=duck&tbm=isch) to search for duck images).

Make sure you pick a ***JPEG***, ***PNG***, ***TIF*** or ***BMP*** format with a resolution below 1024 by 1024 pixels else you will receive a 400 error response.

Now, scroll down and click on **Execute**.

In the **Response Body**, you will get the top 5 classes/label with an associated score (that sums up to 1).

### Optional

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Investigate similar services)]

You can also try the following Machine Learning Functional Services consuming images:

 - **[Product Image Classification API](https://api.sap.com/api/product_image_classification_api/resource)**
 - **[Multi-Instance Image Segmentation](https://api.sap.com/api/instance_segmentor_api/resource)**
 - **[Scene Text Recognition](https://api.sap.com/api/scene_text_recognition_api/resource)**
 - **[Face Detection](https://api.sap.com/api/face_detection_api/resource)**
 - **[Customizable Object Detection](https://api.sap.com/api/object_detection_api/resource)**
 - **[Human Detection](https://api.sap.com/api/human_detection_api/resource)**

Alternatively, you can try to compress into a zip a series of images and call the service.
