## Prerequisites  
 -  Tutorial : [Create an ABAP Package](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-dev-create-package.html)
 -  You have opened the SAP Cloud Platform cockpit and navigated to the correct space. See [SAP Help Portal: SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/e47748b5bb571014afedc70595804f3e.html)
 -  The communication arrangement `SAP_COM_0276` was created with service instance name `OutboundCommunication`. (See below for more information.)

## Details
### You will learn  
  - How to call an external API from inside an ABAP system

---
Predefined communication scenarios allow you to, for example, exchange data between a SAP Cloud Platform system and an external system.
A communication arrangement specifies the metadata for a communication scenario. (For more information, see [Maintain a Communication Arrangement for an Exposed Service](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-communication-arrangement.html).)

You will create a new destination for an existing communication arrangement, specifying the URL for an external API, user/password, and authentication.
You will then create a class that calls the API and displays the output from it in the console.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Navigate to the communication arrangement instance)]
First, navigate to the communication arrangement instance `OutboundCommunication`.

1. In your space in the **SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit**, open **Service Marketplace** and choose **Destination**:

2.  Choose **Instances > `OutboundCommunication`**:

    ![Image depicting step-1b-outboundcomm](step-1b-outboundcomm.png)

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Create a new destination)]

1. Choose **New Destination**:

    ![Image depicting step-2a-new-destination](step-2a-new-destination.png)

2. Then enter the following (replacing **`xxx`** with your group number). Then choose **Save**:
    - Name  = `Z_CHUCKNORRIS_xxx`
    - URL = `http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random?limitTo=[nerdy]`
    - Proxy type = Internet
    - Authentication = `NoAuthentication`

    ![Image depicting step-2b-config-dest](step-2b-config-dest.png)  

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Check the connection)]
Check the connection:

![Image depicting step-3-test-connection](step-3-test-connection.png)  

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Create an ABAP class)]
Now, you will create an ABAP class that will call your destination, and which you can run in the console.

1. In the ABAP Development Tools `(ADT)`, in the Package Explorer, select your package and choose **New > ABAP Class** from the context menu:

    ![Image depicting step-4a-create-class](step-4a-create-class.png)

2. Enter a name and description for your class and choose Next. **Remember to change `XXX` to your group number**:

    ![Image depicting step-4b-name-class](step-4b-name-class.png)

3. Choose or create a transport request, then choose Finish:

    ![Image depicting step-4c-class-transport-request](step-4c-class-transport-request.png)

The class is displayed in a new editor:

![Image depicting step-4d-class-editor](step-4d-class-editor.png)

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 5: ](Add an interface statement)]
Now you will implement the class.
Add the following `interfaces` statement to the public section:

```ABAP
PUBLIC SECTION.
  INTERFACES if_oo_adt_classrun.
PRIVATE SECTION.
```
This enables you to run the class in the console.

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Implement the method)]
  1. Add the method implementation below and wrap it in an exception.
  2. Then replace the `xxx` of `i_name` with your group number. Leave the service instance name `ZSAP_COM_0276` as it is.

```ABAP
METHOD if_oo_adt_classrun~main.
    TRY.
        DATA(lo_destination) = cl_http_destination_provider=>create_by_cloud_destination(
          i_name                  = 'Z_CHUCKNORRIS_xxx'
          i_service_instance_name = 'ZSAP_COM_0276'
          i_authn_mode = if_a4c_cp_service=>service_specific ).

        DATA(lo_http_client) = cl_web_http_client_manager=>create_by_http_destination( i_destination = lo_destination ).
        DATA(lo_request) = lo_http_client->get_http_request( ).
        DATA(lo_response) = lo_http_client->execute( i_method = if_web_http_client=>get ).
          out->write( lo_response->get_text( ) ).

      CATCH cx_root INTO DATA(lx_exception).
        out->write( lx_exception->get_text( ) ).
    ENDTRY.
  ENDMETHOD.

```

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 7: ](Check, save, and activate)]
1. Check your syntax (`Ctrl+F2`).
2. Save (`Ctrl+S`) and activate (`Ctrl+F3`) your class.

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 8: ](Run the class in the console)]
Run your class in the console (`F9`).

The output should look something like this:
![Image depicting step-9-console](step-9-console.png)

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 9: ](Test yourself)]
Create the variable `lo_request` using the DATA statement and the `get_http_request` method of the `lo_http_client` object. Enter the correct text below:

[VALIDATE_1]
