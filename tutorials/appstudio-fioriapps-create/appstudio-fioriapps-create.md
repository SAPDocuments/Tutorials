    ```Shell/console
    pwd
    ```
    ![Open new terminal](AppStudio Open Terminal-1_.jpg)

4. Create a new SAP Fiori project using the Yeoman generator.

    ```Shell/console
    yo
    ```
5. In the generator, select the following options:

    >Use the up/down arrow keys to select an option and press ENTER.

    | Step | Parameter | Value |
    |:-----|:----------|:------|
    | A | Run a generator | **Fiori Project** |
    | B | Target running environment | **Cloud Foundry** |
    | C | Template you want to use | **SAPUI5 Application** |

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Add an OData service to the project)]

Now you need to consume a service to bind the UI controls to the service's collection properties. Later, when you test run the app, it will present data coming from the backend service.

1. Open the command palette ( **View > Find Command** or **F1**) and select **Consume SAP Services**.

    ![AppStudio Open Command Palette](AppStudio Command Palette.jpg)
    &nbsp;
    ![Consume SAP Service](AppStudio Consume SAP Service-1.jpg)

2. Select the **ns.BusinessPartners** folder.

    ![Choose the UI module](AppStudio Consume SAP Service-2.jpg)

    >If the project contains more than one HTML5 module, you'll have a list to select from.

3. Choose **My SAP Systems** as the data source.

    ![Choose the data source](AppStudio Consume SAP Service-3.jpg)

    >A list of data sources is displayed.

4. Choose **ES5** as the data source.

    ![Choose data source](AppStudio Consume SAP Service-4.jpg)

5. Choose **`GW_SAMPLE_BASIC`** as the service.

    ![Choose service](AppStudio Consume SAP Service-5.jpg)

    >The service is successfully bound to the application. You can see that the service appears in the module's `manifest.json` `dataSources` section (**`FioriDemo` > `BusinessPartners` > `webapp`**). You can see the service metadata in **`FioriDemo` > `BusinessPartners` > `webapp` > `localService`**.

    >When the deployment process is complete, you should see a notification.

[DONE]
[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 11: ](Get URL to access the application)]

Access your deployed application in the SAP Cloud Platform cockpit. The steps below show you how to create a URL that you can use to access your new application.

1. Access the space to where the app is deployed and go to the **Applications** tab.

    ![Application's space](AppStudio Application Deployment-5_.jpg)

2. Make sure your application is in **Started** state, and  click its name (`FioriDemo_appRouter`). The **Application: `FioriDemo_appRouter` - Overview** page opens.

3. Right-click the URL under **Application Routes** and save the URL in a text file.

    ![Get application base URL](AppStudio Application Deployment-6_.jpg)

4. Locate the `sap.app id` from the `manifest.json` file, located in your HTML5 module, and add it to the copied link after removing the periods.

    ![Link text e.g., Destination screen](AppStudio Application Deployment-3_.jpg)

    > For future reference, this is the construct of the final URL: `<URL_from_application_overview_page>/<mynamespace><project_name>/index.html`

    You can use this URL in any browser to access your new application.
