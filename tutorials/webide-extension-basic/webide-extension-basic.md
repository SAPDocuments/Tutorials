## Prerequisites  
  - If you don't have a Cloud Foundry account on SAP Cloud Platform, use the tutorial: [Sign up for a free trial account on SAP Cloud Platform](hcp-create-trial-account).

## Details
### You will learn  
  - How to create a basic SAP Web IDE extension project for adding functionality to SAP Web IDE or for use in a tutorial.
  - How to test the new extension within SAP Web IDE.

You use an extension to bundle and deliver plugins, since one extension may be composed of several plugins in order to provide a certain functionality. An extension to be deployed to SAP Cloud Platform is an application created with a multi-target application (MTA) project.

You'll start by creating an extension project that contains a single plugin. You'll use the **SAP Web IDE Extension (MTA Project)** template, which generates basic extension and plugin structures in your SAP Web IDE Workspace.
