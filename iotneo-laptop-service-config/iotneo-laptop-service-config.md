[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Deploy Message Management Service)]

With IoT service enabled, you can begin the steps necessary to configure your device's digital twin and to enable message communication.

The first step will be to deploy and to configure the Message Management Service (MMS). Click on the **Deploy Message Management Service** tile.

Enter in your information in the fields, where your account ID is your p-number (or s-number if you are SAP's customer or partner, or i-/d-number if you are SAP employee) with the world "trial" (no space between the p-number and trial) and your user name is just your p-number.
