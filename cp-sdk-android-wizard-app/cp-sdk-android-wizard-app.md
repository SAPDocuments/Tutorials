[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Create and run the project)]
Open **Android Studio**.

![Android Studio](android-studio.png)


Choose **Start a new SAP Cloud Platform Android project**.

![New project](new-project.png)


The wizard can save the server connection details for multiple servers. Fill in the required fields as shown below.
>Ensure you have completed the prerequisites for this tutorial before continuing to guarantee that you have an account.

| Field | Value |
|----|----|
| Account Name | `SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services Trial` |
| Admin API URL | See below for how to get this URL |
| Admin UI URL | See below for how to get this URL |
| Username | Username for your trial account user |
| Password | Password for your trial account user |
| Save Account Information | Check the first time the account info so it does not have to be re-entered on subsequent runs of the wizard |

Go to the SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services website and under **Important Links**, both URLs will be present

![Admin API and UI URL](admin-url.png)

![Server connection](server-connection.png)

Click **Next** on the **Server Connection** tab.


On the **Cloud Configuration** tab select **Create** and provide the required information.

| Field | Value |
|----|----|
| Application Name | `Wiz App` |
| Application ID | `com.sap.wizapp` |
| Authentication Type | `Basic` |

![Create tab information](create-application-wizard.png)

Click **Next** to configure the OData Services.


![OData services blank](odata-services-blank.png)

The SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services provides a sample backend destination named `com.sap.edm.sampleservice.v2` that is being used here to provide data for the application. It contains product categories, product, supplier, customer and sales order data. Since you are creating a new application, add `com.sap.edm.sampleservice.v2`.

![OData services add service](odata-services-add.png)

Click **Next** to continue to the Project Configuration.

![OData services done](odata-services.png)


On the **Project Configuration** tab provide the following configuration data:

| Field | Value |
|----|----|
| Project Name | `Wiz App` |
| Project Namespace | `com.sap.wizapp` |
| Use Discovery Service for Application bootstrapping | uncheck |
| Generate Master-Detail Application | check |
| Enable Logging | check |
| Enable Upload | check |
| Enable Push | optional |

If you would like to add push notification support to your application, proceed to the next section. Otherwise, click **Finish** and skip the next section, which describes how to acquire a `google-services.json` file needed for push messaging..

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Enable push notifications (optional))]

Check the **Enable Push** checkbox to enable push notification support in the app. You will notice that an error message has appeared explaining that you need to specify a `google-services.json` file. We will obtain this file from the <a target="_blank" href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/">Cloud Messaging</a> feature in <a target="_blank" href="https://firebase.google.com/">Google Firebase</a>.

![Push Notifications enabled](push-notification-checkbox-enabled.png)


Open the <a target="_blank" href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> console and click on **`Add project`**.

![Add project in Firebase](firebase-add-project.png)

Access **`Project Settings`** for the newly created project.  

![Project settings](firebase-project-settings.png)


Add Firebase to your app.

![Add Firebase to your Android app](add-firebase-to-android.png)


The **Android package name** must match the **Project Namespace** used when creating the app in Android Studio. In our example, the **Android package name** is `com.sap.wizapp`.

![Register App](firebase-register-app.png)


Download the **`google-services.json`** file.

![Download google-services.json file](download-google-services-button.png)


Now browse for the **`google-services.json`** file in the wizard. This will enable the app to work with Google Firebase notifications.

![Add google-services.json file to wizard](wizard-google-services-added.png)

>The push configuration on the server will be added in the tutorial Send notifications to your application.


Click **Finish**.

![Run the project](run.png)


Choose the emulator to run the app on.  
>For more information on creating Virtual Devices that run in the Android Emulator, see <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds">here</a>.

![Deployment target](choose-emulator.png)


The welcome screen is shown the first time the app is run.

![Welcome screen](welcome-screen.png)


Sign in with the your credentials.

![Authentication screen](authentication-screen.png)


The entered credentials, are securely stored by the app, and do not need to be re-entered the next time the app is opened.

The passcode (or fingerprint if enabled) screen provides an additional layer of security for your app.  The passcode policy can be modified in the Mobile Service Cockpit under Client Policies feature.

![Passcode screen](create-passcode.png)


The first screen of the app shows the different entities that are in the sample OData service.

![Entities screen](entities-screen.png)
