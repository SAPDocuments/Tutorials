[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 4: ](Give developers permission to SAP Web IDE)]

>This step is only needed if you have configured a corporate SAML identity provider (`IdP`) for your account. For more information, see [Maintaining an `IdP` Mapping Rule for a User Group](https://help.sap.com/viewer/825270ffffe74d9f988a0f0066ad59f0/CF/en-US/315b851aea2d49e688cd3350f5fb763c.html)

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 6: ](Set up Cloud Foundry environment - OPTIONAL)]
If your scenario includes deploying apps to the Cloud Foundry environment, then you need to also set up this environment. These will generally be for full-stack applications that include database and Java modules.

Do the following:



* [Create Cloud Foundry subaccounts, organizations, and spaces](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/76e79d62fa0149d5aa7b0698c9a33687.html).
We recommend you create separate subaccounts for development, staging/test and production purposes. We also recommend at least one space per development team per project (in the development and staging subaccounts).
* [Register your developers](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/5a91cf502b5146958977a5fb906df93a.html)
* [Assign developers to organizations and spaces](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/bbaef4ec39af493192a7a518b94e071b.html).
