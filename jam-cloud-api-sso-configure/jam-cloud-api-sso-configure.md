## Details
### You will learn  
In this tutorial, you will learn how to configure the SAP Cloud Platform Destination for SAP Jam Collaboration API SSO.

Connectivity destinations are a part of the SAP Cloud Platform connectivity service and are used for the outbound communication of a cloud application to a remote system like SAP Jam Collaboration. They contain the connection details for the remote communication of an application. Connectivity destinations are represented by symbolic names that are used by on-demand applications to refer to remote connections. The connectivity service resolves the destination at runtime based on the symbolic name provided. The result is an object that contains customer-specific configuration details, such as the URL of the remote system or service, the authentication type, and the relative credentials.
