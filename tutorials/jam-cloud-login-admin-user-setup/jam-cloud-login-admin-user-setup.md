When you log into SAP Jam, you will be presented with the Company Wiki page. This page provides you with useful information about your environment as well as links to resources and documentation.

Once you have reviewed this information, click on the Home menu option and you will be taken to your Home feed. This is your own personal feed, showing you activities that you should be interested in from people you follow, groups you're a member of and notifications sent directly to you. This is not to be mistaken with a group feed, which is visible when you're viewing a specific group. When you log in for the first time your feed will be empty.

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Set up new users)]

Collaboration is not possible, or much fun, with only one user so lets add another user.

The SAP Jam Collaboration Developer Edition provides 3 user licenses. The first user to login is automatically assigned as the Company Administrator and consumes one of these licenses. The administrator will always login from the **Go To Service** link within the SAP Jam Services section of the SAP Cloud Platform Account Cockpit.

For additional users, they will need to login separately. To do this you first need to assign **Roles** in the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit. Click on the **Configure Roles** icon.

For the additional users that you require to login to the SAP Jam developer edition, it is necessary to assign each of them the **SAP\_JAM\_USER** role. To do this enter their **SAP ID Service ID** and click **Assign**. Once you have assigned the roles for additional users they will be displayed in the **Individual Users** list as shown below:

Start a new browser window/Incognito window/private browsing session such that you don't pick up any existing sessions and paste the URL. You will be presented with an SAP Jam developer edition login page.

Figure 4: Login as the new user

As you will see from the Login page, the SAP Jam developer edition relies on the SAP ID Service as its Identity Provider (IDP) so any additional users must have an SAP Cloud Platform Identity account.

Once you have entered your credentials, a new user is created in your SAP Jam Developer Edition and you will consume another of the 3 available licenses. You can view the users in your environment by navigating to the Users area of the Admin Console.

You can also remove a user by editing the user and setting their Member Status to Alumni. This will then free up another license for use.
