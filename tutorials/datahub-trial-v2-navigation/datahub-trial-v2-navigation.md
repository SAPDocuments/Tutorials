To access the SAP Data Hub App Launchpad in AWS,  GCP or Azure you need go to the chapters 3.3 and 3.4 as described in the [Getting Started with SAP Data Hub, trial edition] (https://caldocs.hana.ondemand.com/caldocs/help/8772c957-0de5-459b-b98a-27180932f0da_Getting_Started_Guide_v28.pdf) guide.

From the SAP Data Hub Application Launchpad, you can navigate to:

 - SAP Data Hub Modeler
