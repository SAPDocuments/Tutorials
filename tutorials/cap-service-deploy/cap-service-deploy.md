## Prerequisites
- You've finished the tutorial [Create a Business Service with Node.js using Visual Studio Code](cp-apm-nodejs-create-service).  
- If you don't have a Cloud Foundry Trial Subaccount on [SAP Cloud Platform](https://cockpit.hanatrial.ondemand.com/cockpit/) yet, create your [Cloud Foundry Trial Account](hcp-create-trial-account).
- You've downloaded and installed the [cf command line client](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads) for Cloud Foundry as described in the tutorial [Install the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CLI)](cp-cf-download-cli).

## Details
### You will learn  
  - How to deploy your business service on SAP Cloud Platform using the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) and binding appropriate service instances (see the [Developer Guide for Cloud Foundry](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/)).

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Enhance project configuration for SAP HANA)]

It's now time to switch to SAP HANA as a database.

1. In Visual Studio Code add the following configuration in the **`package.json`** file of your `my-bookshop` project (overwrite any existing `cds` configuration):

    ```JSON
    "cds": {
        "requires": {
          "db": {
            "kind": "sql"
          }
        }
      }
    ```
   > `kind:sql` declares the requirement for an SQL database. It evaluates to `sqlite` in the `development` profile (active by default), while in `production` it equals `hana`. This way you don't need to modify this file if you want to switch between the two databases. In the steps below you will learn how to do this.
      
2. In the terminal add the SAP HANA driver as a dependency to your project:

    ```Shell/Bash
    npm add @sap/hana-client --save
    ```

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-END]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Identify SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry endpoint)]

The Cloud Foundry API endpoint is required so that you can log on to your SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry space through Cloud Foundry CLI.

1. Go to the [SAP Cloud Platform Trial Cockpit](https://cockpit.hanatrial.ondemand.com/cockpit#/home/trial) and choose **Enter Your Trial Account**.

2. Navigate to your Subaccount:

    !![subaccount tile](subaccount.png)

3. Copy the **Cloud Foundry API Endpoint** value:

    !![CF API endpoint value](api-endpoint.png)

4. Open a terminal. Authenticate using your login credentials using the following command:

```Shell/Bash
cf login
```
> This will ask you to select CF API, org, and space.

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 3: ](Deploy using cf push)]

Cloud Foundry environment of SAP Cloud Platform has a built-in [cf push](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/push.html) command to deploy applications. It needs the application files plus an optional **`manifest.yml`** file to push the application code and to bind the relevant services to the application.

[OPTION BEGIN [Windows]]

1. As `cf push` can only bind but not create services, you need to create the SAP HANA service manually (along with an HDI container and a database schema):

    ```Shell/Bash
    cf create-service hanatrial hdi-shared my-bookshop-db-hdi-container
    ```

    >This process takes some minutes.

    >Check the status of your service using `cf service my-bookshop-db-hdi-container`.

    >If service creation fails, see the [Troubleshooting guide](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/troubleshooting#hana) for CAP.

2. Now, build and deploy both the database part and the actual application:

    ```Shell/Bash
    SET CDS_ENV production && cds build
    cf push -f gen/db
    cf push -f gen/srv --random-route
    ```

    >This process takes some minutes.

    >The first command creates the SAP HANA table and view definitions along with `manifest.yaml` files in both in `gen/db` and `gen/srv` folders. Look at `gen/db/manifest.yaml` and see that it binds to the `my-bookshop-db-hdi-container` service that you've created in the previous step.

4. In the deploy log, find the application URL in the `routes` line at the end:

    ```
    name:              my-bookshop-srv
    requested state:   started
    routes:            my-bookshop-srv-....cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com
    ```

5. Open this URL in the browser and try out the provided links, for example, `.../catalog/Books`. Application data is fetched from SAP HANA.

[OPTION END]

[OPTION BEGIN [Mac and Linux]]

1. As `cf push` can only bind but not create services, you need to create the SAP HANA service manually (along with an HDI container and a database schema):

    ```Shell/Bash
    cf create-service hanatrial hdi-shared my-bookshop-db-hdi-container
    ```

    >This process takes some minutes.

    >Check the status of your service using `cf service my-bookshop-db-hdi-container`.

    >If service creation fails, see the [Troubleshooting guide](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/troubleshooting#hana) for CAP.

2. Now, build and deploy both the database part and the actual application:

    ```Shell/Bash
    CDS_ENV=production cds build && cf push -f gen/db && cf push -f gen/srv --random-route
    ```

    >This process takes some minutes.

    >The first part of the command creates the SAP HANA table and view definitions along with `manifest.yaml` files in both in `gen/db` and `gen/srv` folders. Look at `gen/db/manifest.yaml` and see that it binds to the `my-bookshop-db-hdi-container` service that you've created in step 2.

3. In the deploy log, find the application URL in the `routes` line at the very end:

        ```
        name:              my-bookshop-srv
        requested state:   started
        routes:            my-bookshop-srv-....cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com
        ```

4. Open this URL in the browser and try out the provided links, for example, `.../browse/catalog/Books`. Application data is fetched from SAP HANA.
